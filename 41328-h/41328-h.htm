<span class="s08">MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span>
The Commencement exercises at St. Catharine's
were over, and everybody in the big assembly-hall
was looking relieved and grateful. Mabel Muriel
Murphy had welcomed our parents and friends to
the convent shades in an extemporaneous speech we
had overheard her practising for weeks; and the
proud face of Mabel Muriel's father, beaming on her
as she talked, illumined the front row like an electric
globe. Maudie Joyce had read a beautiful essay,
full of uplifting thoughts and rare flowers of rhetoric;
Mabel Blossom had tried to deliver her address without
the manuscript, and had forgotten it at a vital
point; Adeline Thurston had recited an original
poem; Kittie James had sung a solo; and Janet
Trelawney had played the Sixth Hungarian Rhapsody
on the piano.</p>

<p>Need I say who read the valedictory? It was I&mdash;May
Iverson&mdash;winner of the Cross of Honor, winner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
of the Crown, leader of the convent orchestra, and
president of the senior class. If there are those who
think I should not mention these honors I will merely
ask who would do it if I did not&mdash;and pause for a
reply. Besides, young as I am, I know full well that
worldly ambitions and triumphs are as ashes on the
lips; and already I was planning to cast mine aside.
But at this particular minute the girls were crying
on one another over our impending parting, and our
parents were coming up to us and saying the same
things again and again, while Sister Edna was telling
Mabel Muriel Murphy, without being asked, that
she was not ashamed of one of us.</p>

<p>I could see my father coming toward me through
the crowd, stopping to shake hands with my classmates
and tell them how wonderful they were; and
I knew that when he reached me I must take him out
into the convent garden and break his big, devoted
heart. At the thought of it a great lump came into
my throat, and while I was trying to swallow it I felt
his arm flung over my shoulder.</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed me. "Well, my girl,"
he said, "I'm proud of you."</p>

<p>That was all. I knew it was all he would ever say;
but it meant more than any one else could put into
hours of talk. I did not try to answer, but I kissed
him hard, and, taking his arm, led him down-stairs,
through the long halls and out into the convent garden,
lovely with the scent of roses and honeysuckle
and mignonette. He had never seen the garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
before. He wanted to stroll through it and glance
into the conservatories, to look at the fountain and
visit the Grotto of Lourdes and stand gazing up at
the huge cross that rises from a bed of passion-flowers.
But at last I took him into a little arbor and
made him sit down. I was almost glad my delicate
mother had not been able to come to see me graduate.
He would tell her what I had to say better than I could.</p>

<p>When I have anything before me that is very
hard I always want to do it immediately and get it
over. So now I stood with my back braced against
the side of the arbor, and, looking my dear father
straight in the eyes, I told him I had made up my
mind to be a nun.</p>

<p>At first he looked as if he thought I must be joking.
Then, all in a minute, he seemed to change from a
gallant middle-aged officer into a crushed, disappointed
old man. He bowed his head, his shoulders
sagged down, and, turning his eyes as if to keep me
from seeing what was in them, he stared out over
the convent garden.</p>

<p>"Why, May!" he said; and then again, very
quietly, "Why, May!"</p>

<p>I told him all that was in my mind, and he listened
without a word. At the end he said he had
thought I wanted to be a newspaper woman. I admitted
that I had felt that desire a year ago&mdash;when I
was only seventeen and my mind was immature. He
sat up in his seat then and looked more comfortable&mdash;and
younger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll put my answer in a nutshell," he said.
"You're too young still to know your mind about
anything. Give your family and the world a chance.
I don't want you to be a nun. I don't want you to
be a newspaper woman, either. But I'll compromise.
Be a newspaper woman for three years."</p>

<p>I began to speak, but he stopped me. "It's an
interesting life," he went on. "You'll like it. But
if you come to us the day you are twenty-one and
tell us you still want to be a nun I promise that your
mother and I will consent. Give us a chance,
May." And he added, gently, "<i>Play fair</i>."</p>

<p>Those two words hurt; but they conquered me.
I agreed to do as he asked, and then we sat together,
hand in hand, talking over plans, till the corners of
the garden began to look mysterious in the twilight.
Before we went back to the assembly-room it was understood
that I was to go to New York in a week
and begin my new career. Papa had friends there
who would look after me. I was sure they would
never have a chance; but I did not mention that to
my dear father then, while he was still feeling the
shock of decision.</p>

<p>When I was saying good-by to Sister Irmingarde
six days later I asked her to give me some advice
about my newspaper work. "Write of things as they
are," she said, without hesitation, "and write of them
as simply as you can."</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed. I had expected something
inspiring&mdash;something in the nature of a trumpet-call.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
I suppose she saw my face fall, for she
smiled her beautiful smile.</p>

<p>"And when you write the sad stories you're so
fond of, dear May," she said, "remember to let your
readers shed their own tears."</p>

<p>I thought a great deal about those enigmatic words
on my journey to New York, but after I reached it
I forgot them. It was just as well, for no one associated
with my work there had time to shed tears.</p>

<p>My editor was Mr. Nestor Hurd, of the <i>Searchlight</i>.
He had promised to give me a trial because
Kittie James's brother-in-law, George Morgan, who
was his most intimate friend, said he must; but I
don't think he really wanted to. When I reported to
him he looked as if he had not eaten or slept for
weeks, and as if seeing me was the one extra trouble
he simply could not endure. There was a bottle of
tablets on his desk, and every time he noticed it he
stopped to swallow a tablet. He must have taken
six while he was talking to me. He was a big man,
with a round, smooth face, and dimples in his cheeks
and chin. He talked out of one side of his mouth
in a kind of low snarl, without looking at any one
while he spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh," was his greeting to me, "you're the convent
girl? Ready for work? All right. I'll try you on
this."</p>

<p>He turned to the other person in the office&mdash;a thin
young man at a desk near him. Neither of them
had risen when I entered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, Morris," he said. "Put Miss Iverson
down for the Ferncliff story."</p>

<p>The young man called Morris dropped a big pencil
and looked very much surprised.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" he said. "Why, say, she'll have to stay
out in that house alone&mdash;all night."</p>

<p>Mr. Hurd said shortly that I couldn't be in a
safer place. "Are you afraid of ghosts?" he asked,
without looking at me. I said I was not, and waited
for him to explain the joke; but he didn't.</p>

<p>"Here's the story," he said. "Listen, and get it
straight. Ferncliff is a big country house out on
Long Island, about three miles from Sound View.
It's said to be haunted. Its nearest neighbor is a
quarter of a mile away. It was empty for three years
until this spring. Last month Mrs. Wallace Vanderveer,
a New York society woman, took a year's
lease of it and moved in with a lot of servants. Last
week she moved out. Servants wouldn't stay.
Said they heard noises and saw ghosts. She heard
noises, too. Now the owner of Ferncliff, a Miss
Watts, is suing Mrs. Vanderveer for a year's rent.
Nice little story in it. See it?"</p>

<p>I didn't, exactly. That is, I didn't see what he
wanted me to do about it, and I said so.</p>

<p>"I want you to take the next train for Sound
View," he snarled, impatiently, and pulled the left
side of his mouth down to his chin. "When you get
there, drive out and look at Ferncliff to see what
it's like in the daytime. Then go to the Sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
View Hotel and have your dinner. About ten o'clock
go back to Ferncliff, and stay there all night. Sit up.
If you see any ghosts, write about 'em. If you
don't, write about how it felt to stay there and wait
for 'em. Come back to town to-morrow morning
and turn in your story. If it's good we'll run it.
If it isn't," he added, grimly, "we'll throw it out.
See now?" I saw now.</p>

<p>"Here's the key of the house," he said. "We got
it from the agent." He turned and began to talk to
Mr. Morris about something else&mdash;and I knew that
our interview was over.</p>

<p>I went to Sound View on the first train, and drove
straight from the station to Ferncliff. It was almost
five o'clock, and a big storm was coming up. The
rain was like a wet, gray veil, and the wind snarled
in the tops of the pine-trees in a way that made me
think of Mr. Hurd. I didn't like the look of the
house. It was a huge, gloomy, vine-covered place,
perched on a bluff overlooking the Sound, and set
far back from the road. An avenue of pines led up
to it, and a high box-hedge along the front cut off
the grounds from the road and the near-by fields.
When we drove away my cabman kept glancing
back over his shoulder as if he expected to see the
ghosts.</p>

<p>I was glad to get into the hotel and have a few
hours for thought. I was already perfectly sure
that I was not going to like being a newspaper
woman, and I made up my mind to write to papa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the next morning and tell him so. I thought of the
convent and of Sister Irmingarde, who was probably
at vespers now in the chapel, and the idea of
that assignment became more unpleasant every
minute. Not that I was afraid&mdash;I, an Iverson, and
the daughter of a general in the army! But the
thing seemed silly and unworthy of a convent girl,
and lonesome work besides. As I thought of the
convent it suddenly seemed so near that I could
almost hear its vesper bell, and that comforted me.</p>

<p>I went back to Ferncliff at ten o'clock. By that
time the storm was really wild. It might have been
a night in November instead of in July. The house
looked very bleak and lonely, and the way my
driver lashed his horse and hurried away from the
neighborhood did not make it easier for me to
unlock the front door and go in. But I forced myself
to do it.</p>

<p>I had filled a basket with candles and matches and
some books and a good luncheon, which the landlady
at the hotel had put up for me. I hurriedly lighted
two candles and locked the front door. Then I took
the candles into the living-room at the left of the
hall, and set them on a table. They made two little
blurs of light in which the linen-covered furniture
assumed queer, ghostly shapes that seemed to move
as the flames flickered. I did not like the effect, so I
lighted some more candles.</p>

<p>I was sure the first duty of a reporter was to search
the house. So I took a candle in each hand and went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
into every room, up stairs and down, spending a
great deal of time in each, for it was strangely comforting
to be busy. I heard all sorts of sounds&mdash;mice
in the walls, old boards cracking under my feet,
and a death-tick that began to get on my nerves,
though I knew what it was. But there was nothing
more than might be heard in any other old house.</p>

<p>When I returned to the living-room I looked at
my luncheon-basket&mdash;not that I was hungry, but
I wanted something more to do, and eating would
have filled the time so pleasantly. But if I ate, there
would be nothing to look forward to but the ghost,
so I decided to wait. Outside, the screeching wind
seemed to be sweeping the rain before it in a rising
fury. It was half past eleven. Twelve is the hour
when ghosts are said to come, I remembered.</p>

<p>I took up a book and began to read. I had almost
forgotten my surroundings when a noise sounded on
the veranda, a noise that made me stop reading to
listen. Something was out there&mdash;something that
tried the knob of the door and pushed against the
panels; something that scampered over to the window-blinds
and pulled at them; something that
opened the shutters and tried to peer in.</p>

<p>I laid down my book. The feet scampered back
to the door. I stopped breathing. There followed
a knocking at the door, the knocking of weak hands,
which soon began to beat against the panels with
closed fists; and next I heard a high, shrill voice. It
seemed to be calling, uttering words, but above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
shriek of the storm I could not make out what they
were.</p>

<p>Creeping along the floor to the window, I pulled
back one of the heavy curtains and raised the green
shade under it half an inch. For a moment I could
see nothing but the twisting pines. But at last I
was able to distinguish something moving near the
door&mdash;something no larger than a child, but with
white hair floating round its head. It was not a
ghost. It was not an animal. It could not be a
human being. I had no idea what it was. While I
looked it turned and came toward the window where
I was crouching, as if it felt my eyes upon it. And
this time I heard its words.</p>

<p>"Let me in!" it shrieked. "Let me in! Let me
in!" And in a kind of fury it scampered back and
dashed itself against the door.</p>

<p>Then I was afraid&mdash;not merely nervous&mdash;afraid&mdash;with
a degrading fear that made my teeth chatter.
If only I had known what it was; if only I could
think of something normal that was a cross between
a little child and an old woman! I went to the door
and noiselessly turned the key. I meant to open it
an inch and ask what was there. But almost before
the door had moved on its hinges the thing outside
saw it. It gave a quick spring and a little screech
and threw itself against the panels. The next instant
I went back and down, and the thing that had
been outside was inside.</p>

<p>I got up slowly and looked at it. It seemed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
a witch&mdash;a little old, humpbacked witch&mdash;not more
than four feet high, with white hair that hung in wet
locks around a shriveled brown face, and black eyes
gleaming at me in the dark hall like an angry cat's.</p>

<p>"You little fool!" she hissed. "Why didn't you
let me in? I'm soaked through. And why didn't
that bell ring? What's been done to the wire?"</p>

<p>I could not speak, and after looking at me a
moment more the little old creature locked the hall
door and walked into the living-room, motioning to
me to follow. She was panting with anger or exhaustion,
or both. When we had entered the room
she turned and grinned at me like a malicious monkey.</p>

<p>"Scared you, didn't I?" she chuckled, in her high,
cracked voice. "Serves you right. Keeping me
out on that veranda fifteen minutes!"</p>

<p>She began to gather up the loose locks of her white
hair and fasten them at the back of her head.
"Wind blew me to pieces," she muttered.</p>

<p>She took off her long black coat, threw it over a
chair, and straightened the hat that hung over one
ear. She <i>was</i> a human being, after all; a terribly
deformed human being, whose great, hunched back
now showed distinctly through her plain black dress.
There was a bit of lace at her throat, and when she
took off her gloves handsome rings glittered on her
claw-like fingers.</p>

<p>"Well, well," she said, irritably, "don't stand there
staring. I know I'm not a beauty," and she cackled
like an angry hen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>But it was reassuring, at least, to know she was
human, and I felt myself getting warm again.
Then, as she seemed to expect me to say something,
I explained that I had not intended to let anybody
in, because I thought nobody had any right in the
house.</p>

<p>"Humph," she said. "I've got a better right here
than you have, young lady. I am the owner of this
house and everything in it&mdash;I am Miss Watts. And
I'll tell you one thing"&mdash;she suddenly began to trot
around the room&mdash;"I've stood this newspaper nonsense
about ghosts just as long as I'm going to. It's
ruining the value of my property. I live in Brooklyn,
but when my agent telephoned me to-night that a
reporter was out here working up another lying
yarn I took the first train and came here to protect
my interests."</p>

<p>She grumbled something about having sent her
cab away at the gate and having mislaid her keys.
I asked her if she meant to stay till morning, and
she glared at me and snapped that she certainly
did. Then, taking a candle, she wandered off by herself
for a while, and I heard her scampering around
on the upper floors. When she came back she
seemed very much surprised to hear that I was not
going to bed.</p>

<p>"You're a fool," she said, rudely, "but I suppose
you've got to do what the other fools tell you to."</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">"Don't Stand There Staring. I Know I'm Not a Beauty,"
and She Cackled Like an Angry Hen</span></p>
</div>

<p>After that I didn't feel much like sharing my
supper with her, but I did, and she seemed to enjoy it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Then she curled herself up on a big divan in the
corner and grinned at me again. I liked her face
better when she was angry.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take a nap," she said. "Call me
if any ghosts come."</p>

<p>I opened my book again and read for half an hour.
Then suddenly, from somewhere under the house,
I heard a queer, muffled sound. "<i>Tap, tap, tap</i>," it
went. And again, "<i>Tap, tap, tap</i>."</p>

<p>At first it didn't interest me much. But after a
minute I realized that it was different from anything
I had heard that night. And soon another noise
mingled with it&mdash;a kind of buzz, like the whir of an
electric fan, only louder. I looked at Miss Watts.
She was asleep.</p>

<p>I picked up a candle and followed the noise&mdash;through
the hall, down the cellar steps, and along
a bricked passage. There the sound stopped. I
stood still and waited. While I was staring at the
bricks in front of me I noticed one that seemed to
have a light behind it. I lowered my candle and
examined it. Some plaster had been knocked out,
and through a hole the size of a penny I saw another
passage cutting through the earth like a little catacomb,
with a light at the far end of it. While I was
staring, amazed, the tapping began again, much
nearer now; and I heard men's voices.</p>

<p>There were men under that house, in a secret
cellar!</p>

<p>In half a minute I was standing beside Miss Watts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
shaking her arm and trying to wake her. Almost
before I was able to make her understand what I
had seen she was through the front door and half-way
down the avenue, dragging me with her.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"To the next house, idiot, to telephone to the
police," she said. "Do you think we could stay
there and do it?"</p>

<p>We left the avenue and came into the road, and as
we ran on, stumbling into mud-holes and whipped
by wind and rain, she panted out that the men were
probably escaped convicts from some prison or
patients from some asylum. I ran faster after that,
though I hadn't thought I could. I wondered if I
were having a bad dream. Several times I pinched
myself, but I didn't wake up. Instead, I kept on
running and stumbling and gasping, until I felt sure
I had been running and stumbling and gasping for
years and must keep on doing it for eons more. But
at last we came to a house set far back in big
grounds, and we raced side by side up the driveway
that led to the front door. Late as it was, there
were lights everywhere, and through the long windows
opening on the veranda we could see people
moving about.</p>

<p>Miss Watts gave the bell a terrific pull; some one
opened the door, and we stumbled in. After that
everything was a mixture of questions and answers
and excitement and telephoning, followed by a
long wait for the police. A man led Miss Watts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
me into a room where a fire was burning, and left
us to get warm and dry. When we were alone I
asked Miss Watts if she thought they would keep
us overnight. She stared at me.</p>

<p>"You won't have much time for sleep," she answered,
almost kindly. "It will take you an hour
or two to write your story."</p>

<p>It was my turn to stare, and I did it. "My
story?" I asked her. "To-night? What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>She swung round in her chair and stared at me
harder than ever. Then she cackled in her nastiest
way. "And this is a New York reporter!" she said.
"Why, you little dunce, you know you've <i>got</i> a story,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, doubtfully. "But I'm to
write it to-morrow, after I talk to Mr. Hurd."</p>

<p>Miss Watts uttered a squawk and then a squeal.
"I don't know what fool sent you here," she snapped,
"or what infant-class you've escaped from. But
one thing I do know: You came here to write a
Sunday 'thriller,' I suppose, which would have destroyed
what little value my property has left. By
bull-headed luck you've stumbled on the truth; and
it's a good news story. It will please your editor,
and it will save my property. Now, here's my point."
She pushed her horrible little face close to mine and
kept it there while she finished. "That story is
coming out in the <i>Searchlight</i> to-morrow morning.
I'd do it if I could, but I'm not a writer. So you're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
going to write it and telephone it in to the <i>Searchlight</i>
office within the next hour. Have I made myself clear?"</p>

<p>She had. I felt my face getting red and hot when
I realized that I had a big story and had not known
it. I wondered if I could ever live that down. I
felt so humble that I was almost willing to let Miss
Watts see it.</p>

<p>But before I could answer her there was the noise
of many feet in the hall, with the voices of men.
Then our door was flung open, and a young man
came in, wearing a rain-coat, thick boots covered
with mud, and a wide grin. He was saving time by
shaking the rain off his soft hat as he crossed the
room to us. His eyes touched me, then passed on to
Miss Watts as if I hadn't been there.</p>

<p>"Miss Watts," he said, "the police are here, and
I'm going back to the house with them to see the
capture. I'm Gibson, of the <i>Searchlight</i>."</p>

<p>Miss Watts actually smiled at him. Then she
held out her skinny little claw of a hand. "A real
reporter!" she said. "Thank Heaven! You know
what it means to me to have this thing put straight.
But how do you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"Hurd sent me to look after Miss Iverson," he
explained, glancing at me again. "He couldn't put
her in a haunted house without a watch-dog, but,
to do her justice, she didn't know she had one. I
was in a summer-house on the grounds. I saw you
leave and followed you here. Then I went up the
road to meet the police."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>He grinned at me, and I smiled a very little smile
in return. I wasn't going to give him a whole smile
until I found out how he was going to act about my
story. Miss Watts started for the door.</p>

<p>"Come on," she said, with her hand on the knob.</p>

<p>The real reporter's eyes grew big. "Are <i>you</i>
going along?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Certainly I'm going along," snapped Miss
Watts. "I'm going to see this thing through.
And I'll tell you one thing right now, young man,"
she ended, "if you don't put the <i>facts</i> into your
story I'm going to sue your newspaper for twenty-five
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>He did not answer. His attention seemed to be
diverted to me. I was standing beside Miss Watts,
buttoning my rain-coat and pulling my hat over my
eyes again, preparatory to going out.</p>

<p>"Say, kid," said the real reporter, "you go back
and sit down. You're not in this, you know. We'll
come and get you and take you to the hotel after
it's all over."</p>

<p>I gave him a cold and dignified glance. Then
I buttoned the last button of my coat and went
out into the hall. It was full of men. The real
reporter hurried after me. He seemed to expect
me to say something. So finally I did.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hurd told me to write this story," I explained,
in level tones, "and I'm going to try to write it.
And I can't write it unless I see everything that
happens."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at him and Miss Watts out of the corner
of my eye as I spoke, and I distinctly saw them give
each other a significant glance. Miss Watts shrugged
her shoulders as if she didn't care what I did; but
the real reporter looked worried.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, all right," he said, at last. "I suppose
it isn't fair not to let you in on your own assignment.
There's one good thing&mdash;you can't get any wetter and
muddier than you are." That thought seemed to
comfort him.</p>

<p>We had a hard time going back, but it was
easier because there were more of us to suffer. Besides,
the real reporter helped Miss Watts and me a
little when we stumbled or when the wind blew us
against a tree or a fence. When we got near the
house everybody moved very quietly, keeping close
to the high hedge. We all went around to the back
entrance. There the chief constable began to give
his men orders, and the real reporter led Miss Watts
and me into a grape-arbor, about fifty feet from the
house.</p>

<p>"This is where we've got to stay," he whispered,
pulling us inside and closing the door. "We can see
them come out, and get the other details from Conroy,
who's in charge."</p>

<p>The police were creeping closer to the house.
Three of them took places outside while the rest
went forward. First there was a long silence; then
a sudden rush and crash&mdash;shouts and words that we
didn't catch. Gleams of light flashed up for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
minute&mdash;then disappeared. The men stationed outside
the house ran toward the cellar. There was the
flashing of more light, and at last the police came
out with their prisoners&mdash;and the whole thing was
over. There had not been a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>I was as warm as toast in my wet clothes, but my
teeth were chattering with excitement, and I knew
Miss Watts was excited, too, by the grip of her hand
on my shoulder. The men came toward us through
the rain on their way to the gate, and Mr. Conroy's
voice sounded as if he had been running a race.
But he hadn't. He had been right there.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Watts, we've got 'em," he crowed.
"A nice little gang of amachur counterfeiters.
They've been visitin' you for 'most a year, snug and
cozy; but I guess this is the end of your troubles."</p>

<p>Miss Watts walked out into the rain and, taking a
policeman's electric bull's-eye, looked at the prisoners
one by one. I followed her and looked, too,
while the real reporter talked to Mr. Conroy.
There were three counterfeiters, and they were all
handcuffed and looked young. It could not have
been very hard for six policemen to take them.
One of them had blood on his face, and another was
covered with mud, as if he had been rolled in it.
Miss Watts asked the bloody one, who was also the
biggest one, if his gang had really worked in a secret
cellar at Ferncliff for a year. He said it had been
there about ten months.</p>

<p>"Then you were there all winter?" Miss Watts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
asked him. "And you were so safe and comfortable
that when the tenants moved in and you found they
were all women, except a stupid butler, you decided
to scare them away and stay right along?"</p>

<p>The man muttered something that seemed to
mean that she was right. The real reporter interrupted,
looking busy and worried again. "Miss
Watts," he said, quickly, "can't we go right into
your house and send this story to the <i>Searchlight</i> over
your telephone? It's a quarter to one, and there
isn't a minute to lose. The <i>Searchlight</i> goes to press
in an hour. I've got all the facts," he added, in a
peaceful tone.</p>

<p>Miss Watts said we could, and led the way into
the house, while the counterfeiters and the police
tramped off through the mud and rain. When we
got inside, Miss Watts took us to the library and lit
the electric lights, while the real reporter bustled
about, looking busier than any one I ever saw before.
I watched him for a minute. Then I told Miss
Watts I wanted to go into a quiet room and write my
story. She and the real reporter looked at each
other again. I was getting tired of their looks.
The real reporter spoke to me very kindly, like a
Sunday-school superintendent addressing his class.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Miss Iverson," he said; "you've
had a big, new experience and lots of excitement.
You discovered the counterfeiters. You'll get full
credit for it. Let it go at that, and I'll write the story.
It's got to be a real story, not a kindergarten special."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>If he hadn't said that about the kindergarten
special I might have let him write the story, for I
was cold and tired and scared. But at those fatal
words I felt myself stiffen all over.</p>

<p>"It's my story," I said, with icy determination.
"And I'm going to write it."</p>

<p>The real reporter looked annoyed. "But <i>can</i>
you?" he protested. "We haven't time for experiments."</p>

<p>"Of course I can," I said. And I'm afraid I spoke
crossly, for I was getting annoyed. "I'll write it
exactly the way Sister Irmingarde told me to."</p>

<p>I sat down at the table as I spoke. I heard a
bump and something that sounded like a groan.
The real reporter had fallen into a chair. "Good
Lord!" he said; and then for a long time he didn't
say anything. Finally he began to fuss with his
paper, as if he meant to write the story anyway. I
wrote three pages and forgot about him. At last
he muttered, "Here, let me see those," and his
voice sounded like a dove's when it mourns under the
eaves. I pushed the sheets toward him with my
left hand and went on writing. Suddenly I heard a
gasp and a chuckle. In another second the real reporter
was standing beside me, grinning his widest
grin.</p>

<p>"Why, say, you little May Iverson kid," he almost
shouted, "this story is going to be good!"</p>

<p>I could hear Miss Watts straighten up in the chair
from which she was watching us. She snatched at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
my pages, and he let her have them. I wanted to
draw myself up to my full height and look at him
coldly, but I didn't&mdash;there wasn't time. Besides,
far down inside of me I was delighted by his praise.</p>

<p>"Of course it's going to be good," was all I said.
"Sister Irmingarde told me to write about things
as they are, and very simply."</p>

<p>He had my pages back in his hands now and was
running over them quickly, putting in a few words
here and there with a pencil. I could see he was not
changing much. Then he started on a jump for the
next room, where the telephone was, but stopped at
the door. There was a queer look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Sister Irmingarde's a daisy!" he muttered.</p>

<p>Then I heard him calling New York. "Gimme
the <i>Searchlight</i>," he called. "Gimme the city desk.
Hurry up! Say, Jack, this is Gibson, at Sound View.
We've got a crackerjack of a story out here. No&mdash;the
Iverson kid is doing it. It's all right, too. Get
Hammond busy there and let him take it on the typewriter
as fast as I read it. Ready? Here goes."</p>

<p>He began to read my first page.</p>

<p>Miss Watts got up and shut the door, and I bowed
my thanks to her. The storm was worse than ever,
but I hardly heard it. For a second his words had
made me think of Sister Irmingarde. I felt sorry for
her. She would never have a chance like this&mdash;to
write a real news story for a great newspaper.
The convent seemed like a place I had heard of,
long ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>Then I settled down to work, and for the next hour
there was no sound in the room but the whisper of
my busy pen and the respectful footsteps of Miss
Watts as she reverently carried my story, page by
page, to the chastened "real reporter."</p>

<h2>II<br />

<span class="s08">THE CRY OF THE PACK</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mr. Nestor Hurd, our "feature" editor,
was in a bad humor. We all knew he was,
and everybody knew why, except Mr. Nestor Hurd
himself. He thought it was because he had not a
competent writer on his whole dash-blinged staff,
and he was explaining this to space in words that
stung like active gnats. Really it was because his
wife had just called at his office and drawn his
month's salary in advance to go to Atlantic City.</p>

<p>Over the little partition that separated his private
office from the square pen where his reporters had
their desks Mr. Hurd's words flew and lit upon us.
Occasionally we heard the murmur of Mr. Morris's
voice, patting the air like a soothing hand; and at
last our chief got tired and stopped, and an office boy
came into the outer room and said he wanted to see
me.</p>

<p>I went in with steady knees. I was no longer
afraid of Mr. Hurd. I had been on the <i>Searchlight</i>
a whole week, and I had written one big "story"
and three small ones, and they had all been printed.
I knew my style was improving every day&mdash;growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
more mature. I had dropped a great many amateur
expressions, and I had learned to stop when I
reached the end of my story instead of going right
on. Besides, I was no longer the newest of the "cub
reporters." The latest one had been taken on that
morning&mdash;a scared-looking girl who told me in a
trembling voice that she had to write a special
column every day for women. It was plain that
she had not studied life as we girls had in the convent.
She made me feel a thousand years old instead of
only eighteen. I had received so much advice during
the week that some of it was spilling over, and
I freely and gladly gave the surplus to her. I had
a desk, too, by this time, in a corner near a window
where I could look out on City Hall Park and see the
newsboys stealing baths in the fountain. And I was
going to be a nun in three years, so who cared, anyway?
I went to Mr. Hurd with my head high and
the light of confidence in my eyes.</p>

<p>"'S that?" remarked Mr. Hurd, when he heard
my soft footfalls approaching his desk. He was too
busy to look up and see. He was bending over a
great heap of newspaper clippings, and the veins
bulged out on his brow from the violence of his
mental efforts. Mr. Morris, the thin young editor
who had a desk near his, told him it was Miss Iverson.
Mr. Morris had a muscular bulge on each jaw-bone,
which Mr. Gibson had told me was caused by the
strain of keeping back the things he wanted to say
to Mr. Hurd. Mr. Hurd twisted the right corner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of his mouth at me, which was his way of showing
that he knew that the person he was talking to stood
at his right side.</p>

<p>"'S Iverson," he began (he hadn't time to say
Miss Iverson), "got 'ny money?"</p>

<p>I thought he wanted to borrow some. I had seen
a great deal of borrowing going on during the week;
everybody's money seemed to belong to everybody
else. I was glad to let him have it, of course, but a
little surprised. I told him that I had some money,
for when I left home papa had given me&mdash;</p>

<p>He interrupted me rudely. "Don't want to know
how much papa gave you," he snapped. "Want to
know where 'tis."</p>

<p>I told him coldly that it was in a savings-bank,
for papa thought&mdash;</p>

<p>He interrupted again. I had never been interrupted
when I was in the convent. There the girls
hung on my words with suspended breath.</p>

<p>"'S all right, then," Mr. Hurd said. "Here's
your story. Go and see half a dozen of our biggest
millionaires in Wall Street&mdash;Drake, Carter, Hayden&mdash;you
know the list. Tell 'em you're a stranger in
town, come to study music or painting. Got a little
money to see you through&mdash;'nough for a year. Ask
'em what to do with it&mdash;how to invest it&mdash;and write
what happens. Good story, eh?" He turned to Morris
for approval, and all his dimples showed, making
him look like a six-months-old baby. He immediately
regretted this moment of weakness and frowned at me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"'S all," he said; and I went away.</p>

<p>I will now pause for a moment to describe an interesting
phenomenon that ran through my whole
journalistic career. I always went into an editor's
room to take an assignment with perfect confidence,
and I usually came out of it in black despair. The
confidence was caused by the memory that I had
got my past stories; the despair was caused by the
conviction that I could not possibly get the present
one. Each assignment Mr. Hurd had given me
during the week seemed not only harder than the
last, but less worthy the dignity of a general's
daughter. Besides, a new and terrible thing was
happening to me. I was becoming afraid&mdash;not of
work, but of men. I never had been afraid of anything
before. From the time we were laid in our
cradles my father taught my brother Jack and me
not to be afraid. The worst of my fear now was that
I didn't know exactly why I felt it, and there was no
one I could go to and ask about it. All the men I
met seemed to be divided into two classes. In the
first class were those who were not kind at all&mdash;men
like Mr. Hurd, who treated me as if I were a machine,
and ignored me altogether or looked over my head
or past the side of my face when they spoke to me.
They seemed rude at first, and I did not like them;
but I liked them better and better as time went on.
In the second class were the men who were too kind&mdash;who
sprawled over my desk and wasted my time
and grinned at me and said things I didn't understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and wanted to take me to Coney Island. Most
of them were merely silly, but two or three of them
were horrible. When they came near me they made
me feel queer and sick. After they had left I
wanted to throw open all the doors and windows and
air the room. There was one I used to dream of
when I was overworked, which was usually. He
was always a snake in the dream&mdash;a fat, disgusting,
lazy snake, slowly squirming over the ground near
me, with his bulging green eyes on my face. There
were times when I was afraid to go to sleep for fear of
dreaming of that snake; and when during the day
he came into the room and over to my desk I would
hardly have been surprised to see him crawl instead
of walk. Indeed, his walk was a kind of crawl.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson, Hurd's star reporter, whose desk was
next to mine, spoke to me about him one day, and
his grin was not as wide as usual.</p>

<p>"Is Yawkins annoying you?" he asked. "I've
seen you actually shudder when he came to your
desk. If the cad had any sense he'd see it, too. Has
he said anything? Done anything?"</p>

<p>I said he hadn't, exactly, but that I felt a strange
feeling of horror every time he came near me; and
Gibson raised his eyebrows and said he guessed he
knew why, and that he would attend to it. He must
have attended to it, for Yawkins stopped coming to
my desk, and after a few months he was discharged
for letting himself be "thrown down" on a big story,
and I never saw him again. But at the time Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Hurd gave me his Wall Street assignment I was beginning
to be horribly afraid to approach strangers,
which is no way for a reporter to feel; and when I
had to meet strange men I always found myself
wondering whether they would be the Hurd type or
the Yawkins type. I hardly dared to hope they
would be like Mr. Gibson, who was like the men at
home&mdash;kind and casual and friendly; but of course
some of them were.</p>

<p>Once Mrs. Hoppen, a woman reporter on the
<i>Searchlight</i>, came and spoke to me about them. She
was forty and slender and black-eyed, and her work
was as clever as any man's, but it seemed to have
made her very hard. She seemed to believe in no
one. She made me feel as if she had dived so
deep in life that she had come out into a place where
there wasn't anything. She came to me one day
when Yawkins was coiled over my desk. He crawled
away as soon as he saw her, for he hated her. After
he went she stood looking down at me and hesitating.
It was not like her to hesitate about anything.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said at last; "I earn a good income
by attending to my own business, and I usually
let other people's business alone. Besides, I'm not
cut out for a Star of Bethlehem. But I just want to
tell you not to worry about that kind of thing."
She looked after Yawkins, who had crawled through
the door.</p>

<p>I tried to say that I wasn't worrying, but I couldn't,
for it wasn't true. And someway, though I didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
know why, I couldn't talk to her about it. She
didn't wait for me, however, but went right on.</p>

<p>"You're very young," she said, "and a long way
from home. You haven't been in New York long
enough to make influential friends or create a background
for yourself; so you seem fair game, and the
wolves are on the trail. But you can be sure of one
thing&mdash;they'll never get you; so don't worry."</p>

<p>I thanked her, and she patted my shoulder and
went away. I wasn't sure just what she meant, but
I knew she had tried to be kind.</p>

<p>The day I started down to Wall Street to see the
multimillionaires I was very thoughtful. I didn't
know then, as I did later, how guarded they were in
their offices, and how hard it was for a stranger to
get near them. What I simply hated was having
them look at me and grin at me, and seeing them
under false pretenses and having to tell them lies.
I knew Sister Irmingarde would not have approved
of it&mdash;but there were so many things in newspaper
work that Sister Irmingarde wouldn't approve of.
I was beginning to wonder if there was anything at
all she would approve; and later, of course, I found
there was. But I discovered many, many other
things long before that.</p>

<p>I went to Mr. Drake's office first. He was the one
Mr. Hurd had mentioned first, and while I was at
school I had heard about him and read that he was
very old and very kind and very pious. I thought
perhaps he would be kind enough to see a strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
girl for a few minutes and give her some advice,
even if his time was worth a thousand dollars a
minute, as they said it was. So I went straight to
his office and asked for him, and gave my card to a
buttoned boy who seemed strangely loath to take it.
He was perfectly sure Mr. Drake hadn't time to see
me, and he wanted the whole story of my life before
he gave the card to any one; but I was not yet
afraid of office boys, and he finally took the card and
went away with dragging steps.</p>

<p>Then my card began to circulate like a love story
among the girls at St. Catharine's. Men in little
cages and at mahogany desks read it, and stared at
me and passed it on to other men. Finally it disappeared
in an inner room, and a young man came
out holding it in his hand and spoke to me in a very
cold and direct manner. The card had my real
name on it, but no address or newspaper, and it
didn't mean anything at all to the direct young man.
He wanted to know who I was and what I wanted of
Mr. Drake, and I told him what Mr. Hurd had told
me to say. The young man hesitated. Then he
smiled, and at last he said he would see what he
could do and walked away. In five or six minutes
he came back again, still smiling, but in a pleasanter
and more friendly manner, and said Mr. Drake
would see me if I could wait half an hour.</p>

<p>I thanked him and settled back in my seat to wait.
It was a very comfortable seat&mdash;a deep, leather-covered
chair with big wide arms, and there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
enough going on around me to keep me interested.
All sorts of men came and went while I sat there;
young men and old men, and happy men and
wretched men, and prosperous men and poor men;
but there was one thing in which they were all alike.
Every man was in a hurry, and every man had in his
eyes the set, eager look my brother Jack's eyes hold
when he is running a college race and sees the goal
ahead of him. A few of them glanced at me, but
none seemed interested or surprised to see me there.
Probably they thought, if they thought of it at all,
that I was a stenographer trying to get a situation.</p>

<p>The half-hour passed, and then another half-hour,
and at last the direct young man came out again.
He did not apologize for keeping me waiting twice
as long as he had said it would be.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake will see you now," he said.</p>

<p>I followed him through several offices full of clerks
and typewriters, and then into an office where a little
old man sat alone. It was a very large office, with
old rugs on the floor, and heavy curtains and beautiful
furniture, and the little old man seemed almost
lost in it. He was a very thin old man, and he
sat at a great mahogany desk facing the door. The
light in his office came from windows behind and
beside him, but it fell on my face, as I sat opposite
him, and left his in shadow. I could see, though, that
his hair was very white, and that his face was like an
oval billiard-ball, the thin skin of it drawn tightly
over bones that showed. He might have been fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
years old or a hundred&mdash;I didn't know which&mdash;but he
was dressed very carefully in gray clothes almost as
light in color as his face and hair, and he wore a gray
tie with a star-sapphire pin in it. That pale-blue
stone, and the pale blue of his eyes, which had the
same sort of odd, moving light in them the sapphire
had, were the only colors about him. He sat back,
very much at his ease, his small figure deep in his
great swivel-chair, the finger-tips of both hands
close together, and stared at me with his pale-blue
eyes that showed their queer sparks under his white
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Well, young woman," he said, "what can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>And then I knew how old he was, for in the
cracked tones of his voice the clock of time seemed
to be striking eighty. It made me feel comfortable
and almost happy to know that he was so old. I
wasn't afraid of him any more. I poured out my
little story, which I had rehearsed with his clerk, and
he listened without a word, never taking his narrow
blue eyes from my face. When I stopped he asked
me what instrument I was studying, and I told him
the piano, which was true enough, for I was still
keeping up the music I had worked on so hard with
Sister Cecilia ever since I was eight years old. He
asked me what music I liked best, and when I told
him my favorite composers were Beethoven and
Debussy he smiled and murmured that it was a
strange combination. It was, too, and well I knew it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Sister Cecilia said once that it made her understand
why I wanted to be both a nun and a newspaper
woman.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I was talking to Mr. Drake as
easily as I could talk to George Morgan or to my
father. He asked who my teachers had been, and I
told him all about the convent and my years of
study there, and how much better Janet Trelawney
played than I did, and how severe Sister Cecilia was
with us both, and how much I liked church music.
I was so glad to be telling him the truth that I told
him a great deal more than I needed to. I told him
almost everything there was to tell, except that I
was a newspaper reporter. I remembered not to
tell him that.</p>

<p>He seemed to like to hear about school and the
girls. Several times he laughed, but very kindly, and
<i>with</i> me, you know, not <i>at</i> me. Once he said it had
been a long time since any young girl had told him
about her school pranks, but he did not sigh over
it or look sentimental, as a man would in a book.
He merely mentioned it. We talked and talked.
Twice the direct young secretary opened the door
and put his head in; but each time he took it out
again because nobody seemed to want it to stay
there. At last I remembered that Mr. Drake was
a busy man, and that his time was worth a thousand
dollars a minute, and that I had taken about forty
thousand dollars' worth of it already, so I gasped and
apologized and got up. I said I had forgotten all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
about time; and he said he had, too, and that I must
sit down again because we hadn't even touched upon
our business talk.</p>

<p>So I sat down again, and he looked at me more
closely than ever, as if he had noticed how hot and
red my face had suddenly got and couldn't understand
why it looked that way. Of course he couldn't,
either; for I had just remembered that, though I had
been a reporter for a whole week, I had forgotten
my assignment! It seemed as if I would never learn
to be a real newspaper woman. My heart went
way down, and I suppose the corners of my mouth
did, too; they usually went down at the same time.
He asked very kindly what was the matter, and the
tone of his voice was beautiful&mdash;old and friendly
and understanding. I said it was because I was so
silly and stupid and young and unbusiness-like. He
started to say something and stopped, then sat up
and began to talk in a very business-like way. He
asked where my money was, and I told him the name
of the bank. He looked at his watch and frowned.
I didn't know why; but I thought perhaps it was
because he wanted me to take it out of there right
away and it was too late. It was almost four o'clock.
Then he put the tips of his fingers together again,
and talked to me the way the cashier at the bank had
talked when I put my money in.</p>

<p>He said that the savings-bank was a good place for
a girl's money&mdash;under ordinary conditions it was
the best place. The interest would be small, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
sure. Certain investments would, of course, bring
higher interest, but no woman should try to invest
her money unless she had business training or a very
wise, experienced adviser back of her. Then he
stopped for a minute, and it seemed hard for him
to go on. I did not speak, for I saw that he was
thinking something over, and of course I knew better
than to interrupt him. At last he said that ordinarily,
of course, he never paid any attention to small
accounts, but that he liked me very much and
wanted to help me and that, if I wished, he would
invest my money for me in a way that would bring
in a great deal more interest than the savings-bank
would pay. And he asked if I understood what he
meant.</p>

<p>I said I did&mdash;that he was offering to take entirely
too much trouble for a stranger, and that he was
just as kind as he could be, but that I couldn't think
of letting him do it, and I was sure papa wouldn't
want me to. He seemed annoyed all of a sudden,
and his manner changed. He asked why I had come
if I felt that way, and I began to see how silly it
looked to him, for of course he didn't know I was a
reporter getting a story on investments for women.
I didn't know what to say or what to do about the
money, either, for Mr. Hurd hadn't told me how to
meet any offer of that kind.</p>

<p>While I was thinking and hesitating Mr. Drake
sat still and looked at me queerly; the blue sparks
in his eyes actually seemed to shoot out at me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
They frightened me a little; and, without stopping
to think any more, I said I was very grateful to him
and that I would bring the money to his office the
next day. Then I stood up and he stood up, too;
and I gave him my hand and told him he was the
kindest man I had met in New York&mdash;and the next
minute I was gasping and struggling and pushing him
away with all my strength, and he stumbled and went
backward into his big chair, knocking over an inkstand
full of ink, which crawled to the edge of his
desk in little black streams and fell on his gray
clothes.</p>

<p>For a minute he sat staring straight ahead of him
and let them fall. Then he brushed his hand across
his head and picked up the inkstand and soaked up
the ink with a blotter, and finally turned and looked
at me. I stared back at him as if I were in a nightmare.
I was opposite him and against the wall,
with my back to it, and for a moment I couldn't
move. But now I began to creep toward the door,
with my eyes on him. I felt some way that I dared
not take them off. As I moved he got up; he was
much nearer the door than I was, and, though I sprang
for it, he reached it first and stood there quietly,
holding the knob in his hand. Neither of us had
uttered a sound; but now he spoke, and his voice was
very low and steady.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he said. "I want to tell you
something you need to know. Then you may go."
And he added, grimly, "Straighten your hat!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>I put up my hands and straightened it. Still I
did not take my eyes off his. His eyes seemed like
those of Yawkins and the great snake in my dreams,
but as I looked into them they fell.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, child," he said, irritably, "don't
look at me as if I were an anaconda! Don't you
know it was all a trick?" He came up closer to me
and gave me his next words eye to eye and very
slowly, as if to force me to listen and believe.</p>

<p>"I did that, Miss Iverson," he said, "to show you
what happens to beautiful girls in New York when
they go into men's offices asking for advice about
money. Some one had to do it. I thought the
lesson might come better from me than from a
younger man."</p>

<p>His words came to me from some place far away.
A bit of my bit of Greek came, too&mdash;something about
Homeric laughter. Then next instant I went to
pieces and crumpled up in the big chair, and when
he tried to help me I wouldn't let him come near me.
But little by little, when I could speak, I told him
what I thought of him and men like him, and of what
I had gone through since I came to New York, and
of how he had made me feel degraded and unclean
for ever. At first he listened without a word; then
he began to ask a few questions.</p>

<p>"So you don't believe me," he said once. "That's
too bad. I ought to have thought of that."</p>

<p>He even wrung from me at last the thing that was
worst of all&mdash;the thing I had not dared to tell Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Hoppen&mdash;the thing I had sworn to myself no one
should ever know&mdash;the deep-down, paralyzing fear
that there must be something wrong in me that
brought these things upon me, that perhaps I, too,
was to blame. That seemed to stir him in a queer
fashion. He put out his hand as if to push the idea
away.</p>

<p>"No," he said, emphatically. "No, <i>no</i>! Never
think that." He went on more quietly. "That's
not it. It's only that you're a lamb among the
wolves."</p>

<p>He seemed to forget me, then to remember me
again. "But remember this, child," he went on.
"Some men are bad clear through; some are only
half bad. Some aren't wolves at all; they'll help
to keep you from the others. Don't you get to
thinking that every mother's son runs in the pack;
and don't forget that it's mighty hard for any of us to
believe that you're as unsophisticated as you seem.
You'll learn how to handle wolves. That's a
woman's primer lesson in life. And in the mean
time here's something to comfort you: Though you
don't know it, you have a talisman. You've got
something in your eyes that will never let them
come too close. Now good-by."</p>

<p>It was six o'clock when I got back to the <i>Searchlight</i>
office. I had gone down to the Battery to let
the clean sea-air sweep over me. I had dropped
into a little chapel, too, and when I came out the
world had righted itself again and I could look my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
fellow human beings in the eyes. Even Mr. Drake
had said my experience was not my fault and that
I had a talisman. I knew now what the talisman
was.</p>

<p>Mr. Hurd, still bunched over his desk, was drinking
a bottle of ginger-ale and eating a sandwich
when I entered. Morris, at his desk, was editing
copy. The outer pen, where the rest of us sat, was
deserted by every one except Gibson, who was so
busy that he did not look up.</p>

<p>"Got your story?" asked Hurd, looking straight
at me for the third time since I had taken my place
on his staff. He spoke with his mouth full. "Hello,"
he added. "What's the matter with your eyes?"</p>

<p>I sat down by his desk and told him. The sandwich
dropped from his fingers. His young-old,
dimpled face turned white with anger. He waited
without a word until I had finished.</p>

<p>"By God, I'll make him sweat for that!" he
hissed. "I'll show him up! The old hypocrite!
The whited sepulcher! I'll make this town ring
with that story. I'll make it too hot to hold him!"</p>

<p>Morris got up, crossed to us, and stood beside
him, looking down at him. The bunches on his jaw-bones
were very large.</p>

<p>"What's the use of talking like that, Hurd?" he
asked, quietly. "You know perfectly well you
won't print that story. You don't dare. And you
know that you're as much to blame as Drake is for
what's happened. When you sent Miss Iverson out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
on that assignment you knew just what was coming
to her."</p>

<p>Hurd's face went purple. "I didn't," he protested,
furiously. "I swear I didn't. I thought
she'd be able to get to them because she's so pretty.
But that's as far as my mind worked on it." He
turned to me. "You believe me, don't you?" he
asked, gently. "Please say you do."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," he said. "And I promise
you one thing now: I'll never put you up against a
proposition like that again."</p>

<p>He picked up his sandwich and dropped the matter
from his mind. Morris stood still a minute longer,
started to speak, stopped, and at last brought out
what he had to say.</p>

<p>"And you won't think every man you meet is a
beast, will you, Miss Iverson?" he asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head. I didn't seem to be able to say
much. But it seemed queer that both he and Mr.
Drake had said almost the same thing.</p>

<p>"Because," said Morris, "in his heart, you know,
every man wants to be decent."</p>

<p>I filed that idea for future reference, as librarians
say. Then I asked them the question I had been
asking myself for hours. "Do you think Mr. Drake
really <i>was</i> teaching me a&mdash;a terrible lesson?" I
stammered.</p>

<p>The two men exchanged a look. Each seemed to
wait for the other to speak. It was Gibson who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
answered me. He had opened the door, and was
watching us with no sign of his usual wide and
cheerful grin.</p>

<p>"The way you tell it," he said, "it's a toss-up.
But I'll tell you how it strikes me. Just to be on
the safe side, and whether he lied to you or not,
I'd like to give Henry F. Drake the all-firedest licking
he ever got in his life."</p>

<p>"You bet," muttered Hurd, through the last
mouthful of his sandwich. Mr. Morris didn't say
anything, but the bunches on his jaw-bones seemed
larger than ever as he turned to his desk.</p>

<p>I looked at them, and in that moment I learned
the lesson that follows the primer lesson. At least
one thing Mr. Drake had told me was true&mdash;all men
were not wolves.</p>

<h2>III<br />

<span class="s08">THE GIRL IN GRAY</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Nine typewriters were stuttering over nine
news stories; four electric fans were singing
their siren songs of coolness; two telephone bells were
ringing; one office boy, new to his job, was hurtling
through the air on his way to the night city editor's
desk, and the night city editor was discharging him
because he was not coming faster; the managing
editor was "calling down" a copy-reader; the editor-in-chief
was telling the foreign editor he wished he
could find an intelligent man to take the foreign
desk; Mr. Nestor Hurd was swearing at Mr. Godfrey
Morris. In other words, it was nearly midnight in
the offices of the <i>Searchlight</i>.</p>

<p>I was sitting at my desk, feeling very low in my
mind. That day, for the first time in my three
weeks' experience as a reporter, Mr. Hurd had not
given me an assignment. This was neither his fault
nor mine. I had written a dozen good stories for
him, besides many more that were at least up to the
average. My assignments had taken me to all sorts
of places strangely unlike the convent from which
I had graduated only a month before&mdash;morgues,
hospitals, police stations, the Tombs, the Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
quarter&mdash;and I had always brought back something,
even, as Mr. Gibson had once muttered, if it were
merely a few typhoid germs. Mr. Gibson did not
approve of sending me to all those places. Only
that morning I had heard my chief tell Mr. Morris
the Iverson kid was holding down her job so hard
that the job was yelling for help. This was a compliment,
for Mr. Hurd never joked about any one
who worked less than eighteen hours a day.</p>

<p>I knew he hated to see me idle now, even for a few
hours, and I did not like it myself. But we both
had to bear it, for this had been one of the July days
when nothing happened in New York. Individuals
were born, and married, and died, and were run
over by automobiles, as usual; but, as Mr. Hurd
said, "the element of human interest was lacking."
At such times the newspapers fill their space with
symposiums on "Can a Couple Live on Eight
Dollars a Week?" or "Is Suicide a Sin?" Or they
have a moral spasm over some play and send the
police to suppress it. The night before Mr. Hurd
had sent Gibson, his star reporter, with a police
inspector, to see a play he hoped the <i>Searchlight</i>
could have a moral spasm over. Mr. Gibson reported
that the police inspector had left the theater
wiping his eyes and saying he meant to look after his
daughters better hereafter; so the <i>Searchlight</i> could
not have a spasm that time, and Mr. Hurd swore
for five minutes without repeating once. He was
wonderful that way, but not so gifted as Col. John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Cartwell, the editor-in-chief, who used to check himself
between the syllables of his words to drop little
oaths in. Such conversation was new and terrible
to me. I had never heard any one swear before, and
at first it deeply offended me. I thought a convent
girl should not hear such things, especially a girl who
intended to be a nun when she was twenty-one.
But after a week or two I discovered that the editors
never meant anything by their rude words; they
were merely part of their breath.</p>

<p>To kill time that evening I wrote a letter to my
mother&mdash;the first long one I had sent her since I left
my Western home. I wrote it on one side of my
copy paper, underlining my "u's" and overlining my
"n's," and putting little circles around all my periods,
to show the family I was a real newspaper woman at
last. When I finished the letter I put it in an office
envelope with a picture of the <i>Searchlight</i> building
on the outside, and began to think of going home.
But I did not feel happy. I realized by this time
that in newspaper work what one did yesterday does
not matter at all; it is what one does to-day that
counts. In the convent we could bask for a fortnight
in the afterglow of a good recitation, and the
memory of a brilliant essay would abide, as it were,
for months. But full well I knew that if I gave Mr.
Hurd the biggest "story" of the week on Thursday,
and did nothing on Friday, he would go to bed
Friday night with hurt, grieved feelings in his heart.
This was Friday.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>However, there was no sense in waiting round the
office any longer, so I put on my hat and left the
<i>Searchlight</i> building, walking across City Hall Park
to Broadway, where I took an open car up-town. I
was getting used to being out alone late at night; but
I had not ceased to feel an exultant thrill whenever
I realized that I, May Iverson, just out of the convent
and only eighteen, was actually part of the
night life of great, wonderful, mysterious New York.
Almost every man and woman I saw interested me
because of the story I knew was hidden in each
human heart; so to-night, as usual, I studied closely
those around me. But my three fellow-passengers
did not look as if they had any stories in them.
They were merely tired, sleepy, perspiring men going
home after a day of hard work. I envied them. I
had not done a day's work, and I felt that I hardly
deserved to rest. This thought was still in my mind
when I left the car at Twenty-fifth Street and walked
across Madison Square toward the house where I had
rooms.</p>

<p>It was after midnight and very hot. The benches
in the park still held many men&mdash;most of them the
kind that stay there because they have no place else
to go. There were a dozen tramps, some stretched at
full length and sound asleep, others talking together.
There were men out of work, trying to read the
newspaper advertisements by the electric light from
the globes far above them. Over the park hung a
yellow mist that looked like fog but was merely heat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and from every side came the deep mutter of a great
city on a summer night. The men around me were
the types I had seen every time I crossed the Square,
and, though I was always sorry for them, they no
longer made me feel sick with sympathy, as they did
at first.</p>

<p>But on a bench a little apart from the rest sat a
girl who interested me at once. I noticed her first
because she was young and alone, and then because
she seemed to be in trouble. She was drooping forward
in her seat, with her elbows on her knees and
her chin in her hands, staring hard at a spot on the
ground in front of her. I could not see what it was.
It looked like an ordinary brown stain. I usually
walked very fast when I was alone at night, but now
I slackened my pace and strolled toward the girl
as slowly as I dared, studying her as I went. I could
not see much of her face, which was in the hollow of
her joined hands, but the way she was sitting&mdash;all
bunched up&mdash;showed me that she was sick or discouraged,
or both. She wore a gray dress with a
very narrow skirt, and a wide, plain lace collar on the
jacket. The suit had a discouraged air, as if it had
started out to be smart and knew it had failed. Her
hat was a cheap straw with a quill on it that had
once been stiff but was now limp as an unstarched
collar, and the coil of hair under it was neat and
brown and wavy. Her plain lingerie blouse was cut
low at the neck and fastened with a big black bow,
and when I was closer to her I saw that both her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
shoes were broken at the sides. Altogether, she
looked very sick and very poor, and when she
changed her position a little to glance at a man who
was passing, something about her profile made me
think of one of my classmates at St. Catharine's.</p>

<p>I had tried to pass her, but now my feet would not
take me. It was simply impossible to ignore a girl
who looked like Janet Trelawney and who seemed to
be in trouble. I saw when I got nearer that she was
not Janet, but she might have been&mdash;and, anyway,
she was a young girl like myself. We were taught
at the convent that to intrude on another person's
grief, uninvited, is worse than to intrude at any
other time. Mere sympathy does not excuse it.
But this looked like a special case, for there was no
one else around to do anything for the girl in gray
if she needed help. However, I did not speak to her
at once. I merely sat down on the bench beside her
and waited to see if she would speak to me.</p>

<p>She raised her head the minute she felt me there,
and sat up and stared at me with eyes that were big
and dark and had a queer, desperate expression in
them. It seemed to startle her to know that some
one was so near her, but after she had looked at me
her surprise changed to annoyance, and she moved
as if she meant to get up and go away. That full
glance at her had shown me what she was like.
She was not pretty. Her face was dreadfully pale,
her nose was ordinary in shape, and her firmly set,
thin lips made her mouth look like a straight line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
I did not see how I could have thought of Janet
Trelawney in connection with her. However, I felt
that I could not drive her away from her seat, so I
stopped her and begged her pardon and asked if she
was ill or had hurt herself in any way, and if I could
help her.</p>

<p>At first she did not answer me. She merely sat
still and looked me over slowly, as if she were trying
to make up her mind about me. The longer she
looked the more puzzled she seemed to be. It had
been raining when I left home in the morning, so I
had on a mackintosh and a little soft rainy-day hat.
I knew I did not look impressive, and it was plain that
the girl in gray did not think much of me. At last
she asked what I wanted, and her voice sounded hard
and indifferent&mdash;even rude. I was disappointed in
that, too, as well as in her face. It would have been
more interesting, of course, to help a refined, educated
girl. There was no doubt, however, that she
needed help of some kind, so I merely repeated in
different words what I had said to her at first.
She laughed then&mdash;a laugh I did not like at all&mdash;and
stared at me again in her queer way, as if she could
not make me out. She seemed to be more puzzled
over me than I was over her.</p>

<p>She kept on staring at me a long time with her
singular eyes, that had dark circles under them. At
last she asked me if I was a "society agent" or
anything of that sort, and when I said I was not she
asked how I happened to be out so late, and what I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
was doing. Her voice was as queer as her eyes&mdash;low
and husky. I did not like her manner. It
almost seemed as if she thought I had no right to be
there, so I told her rather coldly that I was a reporter
on the <i>Searchlight</i> and that I was on my
way home from the office. As soon as I said that her
whole manner changed. I have noticed this quick
change in others when they hear that I am a newspaper
woman. Some are pleased and some are not,
but few remain cold and detached. The girl in gray
actually looked relieved about something. She
laughed again, a husky, throaty laugh that sounded,
however, much nicer and more human than before,
and gave me a good-natured little push.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "all right. Better beat it now.
So-long." And she waved me away as if she owned
the park bench. I hesitated. I was sorry now that
I had stopped, and I wanted to go; but it seemed
impossible to leave her there. I sat still for a
moment, thinking it over, and suddenly she leaned
toward me and advised me very earnestly not to
linger till the roundsman came to take my pedigree.
She said he was letting her alone because he knew
she was only out of the hospital two days and up
against it, but the healthy thing for me was to move
on while the walking was good.</p>

<p>I was sorry she used so much slang, but of course
the fact that she was unrefined and uneducated made
her situation harder, and demanded even more sympathy
from those better off. What she had said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
about the hospital and being "up against it" proved
that I had done right to stop.</p>

<p>I told her I was going home in a few minutes, but
that I wanted to talk to her first if she did not mind,
and that there was no reason why I could not sit in
the park if she could. She looked at me and laughed
again as if I had made a joke, and the laugh brought
on an attack of coughing which kept her busy for a
full minute. When she had stopped I pointed out
my home to her. It was on the opposite side of the
Square, but we could see it quite plainly from where
we sat. We could even see the windows of my rooms,
which faced the park. The girl in gray looked up at
them a long time.</p>

<p>"Gee!" she said, "you're lucky. Think of havin' a
joint to fall into, and not knowin' enough to go to it
when you got a chance." She added, "It wouldn't
take me long to hop there if I owned the latch-key."</p>

<p>I asked her where she lived, and she laughed again
and swung one knee over the other as we were
taught in the convent not to do, and muttered that
her present address was Madison Square Park, but
she hoped it would not be permanent. Then she
got up and said, "So-long," and started to go. I
got up, too, and caught her arm. Her last words
had simply thrilled me. I had read about girls being
sick and out of work and being dismissed from the
hospital with no money and no place to go to. But
to read of them in books is one thing, and to see one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
with your own eyes, to have one actually beside you,
is another thing&mdash;and very different. My heart
swelled till it hurt; so did my throat. The girl shook
off my hand.</p>

<p>"Say," she said, and her voice was rude and cross
again&mdash;"say, kid, what's the matter with you? You
ain't got nothin' on me. Beat it, will you, or let me
beat it. I can't set here and chin."</p>

<p>I held her arm. I knew what was the matter.
She was too proud to ask for help. I knew another
thing, too. There was a story in her, the story of
what happens to the penniless girl in New York;
and I could get it from her and write it and put the
matter on a business basis that would mean as much
to her as to me. Then I would have my story, the
story I had not got to-day, and she would have a
room and shelter, for of course I would give her some
money in advance. My mind worked like lightning.
I saw exactly how the thing could be done.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," I said. "Forgive me&mdash;but
you're hungry, aren't you?"</p>

<p>She stared at me again with that queer look of hers.
Then she answered with simple truth. "You bet I
am," she muttered.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, and I put all the will-power I
had in my voice. "Come with me and get something
to eat. Then tell me what has happened to you.
Perhaps I can make a newspaper story of it. If I
can, we'll divide the space rates."</p>

<p>The girl in gray hung back. I could see that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
wanted to go with me, but that for some reason she
was afraid.</p>

<p>"Say," she said at last, "you're kidding ain't you?
You don't look like a reporter nor act like one.
Honest, you got me guessin'."</p>

<p>I did not like that very much, but I could not
blame her. I knew it required more than three
weeks to make one look like a real newspaper
woman. I opened my hand-bag and took out one of
the new cards I had had engraved, with <i>The New
York Searchlight</i> down in the left-hand corner. It
looked beautiful. I could see that at last the girl
in gray was impressed. She stood with the card in
her hand, staring down at it and thinking. Finally
she shrugged her shoulders and clapped me on the
back with a force that hurt me.</p>

<p>"Al-l-l <i>right</i>!" she said, drawling out the first word
and shooting the second at me like a bullet from a
pistol. "I got the goods. I'm just out of Bellevue.
I'll give you a spiel about the way those guys treated
me. I'll tell you about the House of Detention, too,
and the judges and the police. Oh, I got a story, all
right, all right. I'll give it to you straight."</p>

<p>She was pulling me along the street as she talked.
She seemed to be in a great hurry all of a sudden,
and in good spirits, but I realized how weak she was
when I saw that even to walk half a block made her
breath come in little gasps.</p>

<p>"It's the eats first, ain't it?" she asked; and I told
her it certainly was. Then I asked her where we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
were going, for it was clear that she was headed for
some definite place.</p>

<p>"Owl-wagon," she told me, and saved her breath
for the walk. I said we would take a car, but she
pointed to the "owl-wagon" standing against the
curb only a square away. The sight of it seemed to
give her fresh strength. She made for it like a
carrier-pigeon going home. When we reached it she
sat down on the curbstone and nodded affably to the
man inside the wagon. He nodded back at her and
then came through the door and down the wagon
steps to stare at me.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said to the girl in gray. "Heard you
was sick. Glad to see you round again. What'll
you eat?"</p>

<p>She did not waste breath on him, but made a
gesture toward me. For a moment I think she
could not speak.</p>

<p>"Give her a large glass of milk first," I told the
man&mdash;"not too cold." When I handed it to her I
advised her to drink it slowly, but she did not. It
vanished in one long gulp. While the man was filling
another glass for her I asked her what she wanted
for supper. Eating at the "owl" was a new experience
to me. I began to enjoy it, and to examine the
different kinds of food that stood on the little shelves
around the sides of the wagon. The girl in gray
looked at me over the rim of her glass.</p>

<p>"What'll you stand for?" she asked.</p>

<p>I laughed and told her to choose for herself; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
could have everything in the wagon if she wanted it.
Before the words were past my lips she was on the
top step, selecting sandwiches and pie and ordering
the man around as if she owned the outfit. She
took three sandwiches, one of every kind he had, and
two pieces of pie, and some doughnuts. When she
had all she wanted she got down from the wagon and
backed carefully to the curb, balancing the food in
her hands. Then she sat down again and smiled
at me for the first time. Something about that
smile made me want to cry; but she seemed almost
happy.</p>

<p>"Ain't this a bit of all right?" she asked, with her
mouth full. She told the proprietor that his pies had
less sawdust in them than last year and that he must
have put some real lemon in one of them by mistake.
While they talked I continued to inspect the inside
of the wagon, but I heard the owl-man ask her a
question in a whisper that must have reached across
the street. "Say, Mollie, who's your friend?" he
wanted to know.</p>

<p>The girl in gray told him it was none of his business.
Her speech sounded strangely like that of
Mr. Hurd. There were several of his favorite words
in it. I sighed. She was a dreadfully disappointing
girl, but she had been starving, and I had only to
look at her face and her poor torn shoes to feel sympathy
surge up in me again. When she was finishing
her last piece of pie she beckoned to me to come and
sit beside her on the curb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>"Now for the spiel," she said, and her husky
voice sounded actually gay. "You got the key.
Wind me up. I'll run 's long's I can."</p>

<p>I looked around. The street was deserted except
for two men who stood beside the owl-wagon munching
sandwiches. They stared hard at us, but did
not come near us. There was a light in the wagon,
too, by which I might have made some notes. But I
did not want to get my story at one o'clock in the
morning out on a public avenue. I wanted a room
and a reading-lamp and chairs and a table. Six
months later I could write any story on the side of
a steam-engine while the engine was in motion, but
this was not then. Besides, while the girl was eating
I had had an inspiration. I asked her if she had
really meant what she said about having no place
to go but the park; and when she answered that she
had, I asked her where she would have gone that
night if I had not come along. She looked at me,
hesitated a moment, and then turned sulky.</p>

<p>"Aw, what's the use?" she said. "Get busy. Do
I give you the story, or don't I?"</p>

<p>I told her she did. Then I produced my inspiration.
"Aren't there homes for the friendless," I
asked her, "where girls are taken in for a night
when they have no money?"</p>

<p>The girl in gray said there were, and sat eyeing
me with her lower jaw lax and a weary, discouraged
air.</p>

<p>"All right," I said, briskly; "let's go to one."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>It took her a long time to understand what I
meant. I had to explain over and over that I wanted
to go with her and see exactly how girls were received
and treated in such places and what sort of
rooms and food they got, and that I must play the
part of a penniless and friendless girl myself to get
the facts; for of course if the people in the "refuge"
knew I was a reporter everything would be colored
for me. At last my companion seemed to grasp my
meaning. She got up, wabbling a little on her weak
knees, and started toward Twenty-third Street.</p>

<p>"Come on, then," she muttered, and added something
about a "funeral" and some one being "crazy."
She said the place we were going to was on First
Avenue, not very far away, but I stopped a car and
made her get into it. As we rode across town she
told me the little she knew about the refuge. She
said girls who went there paid a few cents for their
rooms if they had money, but if not they were sometimes
taken in without charge. She said breakfast
was five cents and dinner ten or more, according to
what one ate. The house closed at midnight, and she
was afraid we could not get in; but she had been
there twice before, and the matron knew she was
sick, so perhaps she would admit us. I was to be
Kittie Smith, a friend of hers from Denver.</p>

<p>I did not like the appearance of the place very
much when we finally reached it. It was like a
prison, I thought, and its black windows seemed
to glower at us menacingly as we looked at them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
We climbed the worn steps that led to the front door;
there were only a few of them, but I had to help the
girl in gray. When we reached the last one, she
rang the bell labeled "Night bell." Beside it a brass
sign that needed polishing told us the institution
was a "Home for Friendless Girls." We could hear
the bell jangling feebly far inside the house, as if
it hung at the end of a loose wire, but for a long
time no one answered it. The girl in gray sat down
on the top step while I rang the bell again. Then
at last steps came along the hall, the door opened
an inch, and an old woman peered out at us. We
could see nothing of her but her eyes and a bit of
white hair. The eyes looked very cross, and the old
woman's voice matched them when she spoke to us.
She asked what we wanted and explained in the
same breath that the house was closed and that it
was too late to get in. The girl in gray leaned back
against the door so the old woman could not close
it, and said in a faint voice that she was sick.</p>

<p>"You remember me, Mrs. Catlin," she added,
coaxingly. "Sure you do. I'm Mollie Clark. I
been here before."</p>

<p>Mrs. Catlin opened the door another inch, grudgingly,
and surveyed Mollie Clark.</p>

<p>"Humph!" she said. "It's you again, is it?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment and again looked Mollie
Clark over. Then she flung the door wide without a
word and let us into a long hall with a bare floor,
whitewashed walls, and a flight of stairs at the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
it. A gas-light, turned very low, burned at the rear,
and the whole house smelled of carbolic acid. It
seemed to me that no girl's situation anywhere could
be as forlorn as that place looked. The old woman
picked up a candle which stood on a table near the
door and lit it at the solitary gas-jet. Then she
motioned to us to follow her and started rheumatically
up-stairs, grumbling under her breath all the
way. She said it was against the rules to let us in
at that hour, and she didn't know what the superintendent
would say in the morning, and that there
was only one room empty, anyhow, and we would
have to be content with it. She led us up three
flights of stairs and into a little hall-room at the
front of the house. It had one window, which was
open. Its furniture was a small bed, a wash-stand
with a white bowl and pitcher, one towel, a table,
and two chairs. My eyes must have lit up when
they saw the table. That was what I wanted, and
I did not care much about anything else.</p>

<p>Mrs. Catlin set the candle down on the table,
whispered something about taking our "records"
in the morning, warned us not to talk and disturb
others, and went away without saying good night.
The minute the door closed behind her I sat down
at the table and got out my pencil and a fat note-book.
I did not even stop to take off my hat, but
Mollie Clark removed hers and threw it in a corner.
Her hair, as I had suspected, was very pretty&mdash;soft
and brown and wavy. She came and sat down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
opposite me at the table and waited for me to
begin.</p>

<p>At first when we got into the room I had felt
rather queer&mdash;almost nervous. But the minute I
had my pencil in my hand and saw my note-book
open before me I forgot the place we were in and
was comfortable and happy. I smiled at Mollie
Clark and told her to tell me all about herself&mdash;the
whole story of her life, so that I could use as much
or as little of it as I wanted to. Of course, she did
not know how to begin. People never do. She
rested her elbows on the table and her chin on her
hands, which seemed to be her favorite attitude,
and sat quite still, thinking. To help her I asked
a few questions. That started her, and at last she
grew interested and more at ease and began to talk.</p>

<p>I will admit right here that before fifteen minutes
had passed I was in an abyss of black despair.
Someway I simply could not get hold of that story,
and when I did begin to get hold of it I was frightened.
It was not because she used so much slang.
I understood that, or most of it. But some of the
things she said I did not understand at all, and when
I showed I did not, or asked her what they meant,
she was not able to explain them. She put them in
a different way, but I did not get them that way,
either; and she looked so surprised at first, and so
discouraged herself toward the end, that at last I
stopped asking her questions and simply wrote
down what she told me, whether I knew what it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
meant or not. After a time I began to feel as if
some one in a strange world was talking to me in
an unknown tongue&mdash;which little by little I began
to comprehend. It seemed a horrible sort of world,
and the words suggested unspeakable things. Once
or twice I felt sick and giddy&mdash;as if something awful
was coming toward me in a dark room and would
soon take hold of me. Occasionally the girl leaned
across the table to look at my notes and see what
I was putting down, and I kept pushing my chair farther
and farther away from her. I hoped it would not
hurt her feelings, but I could not endure her near me.</p>

<p>For five minutes the story went beautifully. She
had run away from home when she was only sixteen&mdash;three
years before; and the home had been
a farm, just as it is in books. She had gone to Denver&mdash;the
farm was thirty miles from Denver, but
not large enough to be a ranch&mdash;and she had worked
for a while in a big shop and afterward in an office.
She had never learned typewriting or shorthand
or expert filing, nor anything of that kind, so she
folded circulars and addressed envelopes, and got
five dollars a week for doing it. She said it was impossible
to live on five dollars a week, and that this
was the beginning of all her trouble.</p>

<p>After that she talked about her life in Chicago
and Detroit and Buffalo and Boston and New York,
and about men who had helped her and women who
had robbed her, and police graft, and a great many
things I had never even heard of.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>For a long time I wrote as fast as my hand could
write. My head seemed to be spinning round on
my shoulders. I felt queerer and queerer, and more
and more certain I was in a nightmare; the worst
part of the nightmare was the steady husky whisper
of the girl's voice&mdash;for of course she had to whisper.
At moments it seemed like the hissing of a snake,
and the girl looked like a snake, too, with her
set straight mouth and her strange, brilliant eyes.
At last, after a long time, I stopped writing and
leaned back in my chair and looked at her. At the
same time she stopped talking and looked back at
me, and for a minute neither of us spoke. Then
she bunched forward in her chair and sat staring
at the floor, exactly the way she had done in the
park.</p>

<p>"It's no go," she said, in a queer, flat voice.
"You ain't gettin' it, are you?"</p>

<p>For a moment I did not answer her. It seemed
someway that I could not. I saw by her face how
she felt&mdash;sick with disappointment. She muttered
some words to herself. They sounded like unpleasant
words; I was glad I did not hear them
clearly. She had counted on her share of the space
rates for my story. She sat still for quite a long
time. Once or twice she looked at me as if she did
not understand why I was allowed to encumber the
earth when I was so stupid. Then she shrugged
her shoulders, and finally she smiled at me in a sick
kind of way. I suppose she remembered that, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
all, I had given her a supper. At last she rose and
picked up her hat and put it on.</p>

<p>"I'll blow out of here," she said. "Sorry you're
out a meal for nothin'."</p>

<p>She turned to go, and I felt more emotions in that
moment than I had ever felt before. There were
dozens of them, but confusion and horror and pity
seemed to be the principal ones. I asked her to
wait a minute, and I went to my hand-bag and took
out my purse. There was not very much in it. I
had been paid on Saturday, and this was Friday,
so of course I had spent most of my money. But
there were six dollars left, and I gave her five of
them.</p>

<p>"What for?" she asked, and stared at me as she
had done in the park.</p>

<p>"For the story," I said. "On account. I'll give
you the rest when it's printed."</p>

<p>She took the bill and stood still, looking down at
it as it lay in her hand. Then suddenly she threw
it on the floor.</p>

<p>"Aw, say," she muttered, "what's the use? It's
like takin' candy from a kid. You'll need that
money," she added, touching the bill with the toe
of her ragged shoe as she spoke. "You'll sure need
it to get back where you come from. You didn't
get that story. You didn't get a word of it."</p>

<p>The look of the ragged shoe as she put it out and
pushed the money away, and the look on her face
as she spoke, made my heart turn over with pity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
for her. I picked up my note-book and held it
toward her.</p>

<p>"Didn't I get it?" I asked. "Look at this."</p>

<p>She took the note-book and turned the pages,
at first slowly and without hope, then with interest.
Finally, without raising her eyes, she sat down by
the flickering candle and read them all. While she
read I watched her, and as I looked I realized that
there was another Watcher in the little room with
us&mdash;one who stood close beside her, waiting, and
who would wait only a few weeks. I knew now
what her cough meant, and her husky voice, and the
stain in the park, and the red spots that came and
went on her thin cheeks.</p>

<p>When she had finished reading the notes she laid
down the book and smiled at me. "Kiddin' me
again, wasn't you?" she said, quietly. "You got
it all here, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I've got the story."</p>

<p>"Sure you have," she corroborated. "That Bellevue
stuff's great. And take it from me, your editor
will eat up the story about Holohan, with the names
<i>an'</i> the dates <i>an'</i> the places. Here's six girls will
swear to what I told you. And Miss Bates, the
probation officer, she'll stand for it, too. I'd have
give it to a paper long ago if I'd known who to go to."</p>

<p>An attack of coughing stopped her words. After
it she leaned against the table for a moment, exhausted.
Then she bent and picked up the bill
from the floor. Last of all she took my pencil out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
of my hand, wrote a name and address in my note-book,
and laid the book back on the table.</p>

<p>"Me for the outer darkness," she said. "That's
where I'll be. I'll stay in till four to-morrow afternoon,
if your editor wants anything else."</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, as if struggling with
words that wouldn't come. "Thanks for the banquet,"
she got out, at last. "So-long."</p>

<p>I looked straight into her strange eyes. There
were many things I wanted to say to her, but I
didn't know how. I felt younger than I had ever
felt before, and ignorant and tongue-tied.</p>

<p>"You stay here," I said. "I'll go home."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes looked big and round as she stared
at me. She held up the five-dollar bill in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Stay here," she gasped, "when I got money to
go somewhere else? D'ye think I'm crazy? <i>You</i>
got to stay an' get the rest of yer story. <i>I</i> ain't!
See?"</p>

<p>I saw.</p>

<p>"You'll go right to that address," I asked, "and
rest?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will," she told me, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I'll bring your half of the money to you as soon
as I get it," I ended. "Probably in two or three
days. And I'm going to send a doctor to see you
to-morrow."</p>

<p>She was on her way to the door as I spoke, but
she stopped and looked back at me. "Say, kid,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
she said, "take my advice. Don't bring the money.
<i>Send</i> it. Get me?"</p>

<p>I nodded. The door closed very softly behind
her. I heard the old stairs creak once or twice as
she crept down them. Then I went to the open
window and leaned out. She was leaving the house,
and I watched her until she turned into a side street.
She walked very slowly, looking to the right and to
the left and behind her, as if she felt afraid.</p>

<p>Two mornings later when I entered the city room
of the <i>Searchlight</i> Mr. Gibson rose and bowed low
before me. Then he backed away, still bowing, and
beckoning to me at the same time. His actions
were mysterious, but I followed him across the room,
and several reporters rose from their desks and followed
us both. Near the city editor's desk Mr.
Gibson stopped, made another salaam, and pointed
impressively to the wall. Tacked on it very conspicuously
was a "model story" of the day&mdash;the
sort of thing the city editor occasionally clipped
from the <i>Searchlight</i> or some other newspaper and
hung there as "an inspiration to the staff." We
were always interested in his "model stories," for
they were always good; I had read some of them
till I knew them by heart. But this particular
morning it was <i>my</i> story which was tacked there&mdash;my
story of the girl in gray!</p>

<p>For a full minute I could not speak. I merely
stood and stared while the reporters congratulated
me and joked around me. While I was still trying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
to take in the stupendous fact that the "model
story of the day" was really mine the city editor,
Mr. Farrell, came and stood beside me. He was a
fat man, with a face like a sad full moon, but he
was smiling now.</p>

<p>"Nice story," he said, kindly. "But don't get a
swelled head over it. You'll probably write a rotten
one to-morrow."</p>

<p>I nodded. Full well I knew I probably would.</p>

<p>"Besides," continued Mr. Farrell, "the best thing
in your story was the tip it gave us for Gibson's big
beat. That was a cub reporter's luck. Thanks to
it, we've got Holohan with the goods on. If you
listen you'll hear him squeal. And oh, by the way,"
he added, as he was turning back to his desk, "we
have a dozen messages already from people who
want to give care and nursing and country homes
to your 'girl in gray.'"</p>

<p>I was glad of that. Also I was interested in
something else, and I mentioned it to Mr. Farrell.
I told him I had felt sure my story was spoiled because
I had left so much out of it. The city editor
looked at me, and then jerked his head toward the
story on the wall.</p>

<p>"It's what you left out of it," he said, "that
makes that a model story."</p>

<h2>IV<br />

<span class="s08">IN GAY BOHEMIA</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
The office door opened with a rush and shut
with a bang. In the little whirlwind caused
by the draught it made, the papers on our desks
rose, swirled in the air, and played tag upon the
floor. Everybody but me stopped work and glanced
up to nod or frown at the woman who had come in.
I did not stop. I knew too well who it was. There
was only one person on the <i>Searchlight</i> whose entrance
caused that sort of commotion. Besides, I
had heard the whisper of silk petticoats, and smelled
the strong odor of <i>peau d'Espagne</i> which always
preceded Miss Mollie Merk to her desk.</p>

<p>Mollie Merk was Mr. Hurd's most sensational
woman reporter&mdash;the one who went up in air-ships
and described her sensations, or purposely fell in
front of trolley-cars to prove that the fenders would
not work. She was what she herself called a "breezy
writer," but her breeziness did not exhaust itself
in her literature. She was a breezy person generally&mdash;small
and thin and dark, and so full of vitality
that she always arrived anywhere as if she had been
projected by some violent mechanical force. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
spoke very rapidly, in short explosive sentences.
She openly despised the young and made epigrams
about them to show her scorn. Before I had been
on the <i>Searchlight</i> a week she announced that I
would be endurable if I had a redeeming vice; and
our fellow-reporters went around quoting that remark
and grinning over it. After I had written a
few "big stories" her manner changed to one of
open wonder, and she began to call me "the convent
kid" and give me advice, addressing me as if
I were an infant class. When she was in the same
room with me I felt that she was mentally patting
my head. I appreciated her kind heart and her
value to the <i>Searchlight</i>; but I did not really like
Mollie Merk.</p>

<p>Usually when she catapulted into the office she
exchanged a few shouts of greeting with "the boys"
and then went directly to her desk, where she
dropped into her chair like a bag of ballast from a
balloon, and began to write with a pen that scratched
louder than any other. But to-night she followed
the <i>peau d'Espagne</i> across the room to me and
clapped her hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"'Lo, Iverson," she said, in her loud and breathless
way. "Still on the job? 'Can' it. I'm your
vesper-bell."</p>

<p>I felt myself instinctively drop away from her
hand. In her greeting she had done two things I
particularly disliked. She had called me "Iverson"&mdash;it
was a vulgar habit of hers to address other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
women by their last names&mdash;and she had spoken
of something connected with my convent life, which
was too sacred to be joked about. Still, I knew she
meant well. I looked up at her and tried to smile,
but all I could do was to drag one side of my mouth
down to my chin in humble imitation of Mr. Hurd
when he is talking to a member of the staff. Mollie
Merk seemed to appreciate it. She roared, and her
hand clapped my shoulder again.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Iverson," she said. "Worst's yet to
come." And she added, all in one breath, "I'm-going-to-give-a-party-for-you!"</p>

<p>I dropped my pen and turned in my chair to stare
at her.</p>

<p>"Been meaning to do it right along," she jerked
out. "Couldn't pull it off. To-night's my chance.
Nothing to do. Fell down on my story. Hurrah!
Give you a Bohemian dinner. Show you life outside
the cloister. Purple pasts. Crimson presents.
All the rest of it. Make your hair curl and your
eyes stick out. Come on!"</p>

<p>Her words gave me a thrill, on which I immediately
put down the stern brake of conscience. As
a student of life I wanted to see and learn all I could&mdash;especially
as I intended to be a nun in three years
and would have no further chances. But was I
justified in deliberately turning aside to seek such
knowledge, when in the broad path of my daily
duty I was already acquiring more than one person
could understand? Also, would it be right to accept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Mollie Merk's hospitality when I did not approve
of her? I decided that it would not; and I
tried to think of some polite and gracious way of
declining her invitation, but the right words did
not come. I had no social engagements, for I was
still a stranger in New York, and Mollie Merk knew
it; and I had not learned to tell lies with unstudied
ease.</p>

<p>Finally an inspiration came to me. I could make
an engagement and then keep it. I thanked Miss
Merk and told her I intended to dine with my
classmates Maudie Joyce and Kittie James. They
had come to New York the day before with Kittie's
sister, Mrs. George Morgan; and as they were only
to stay a week, I felt that I must see all I could of
them. As a matter of fact, I had dined with them
the previous night, but that did not matter. I
knew they would be glad to see me, even two nights
in succession.</p>

<p>Mollie Merk was interested as soon as I spoke of
them. "Classmates?" she yelped. "Two more
convent kids?"</p>

<p>I admitted coldly that Maudie and Kittie had
been graduated with me from St. Catharine's the
month before.</p>

<p>"All right," said Mollie Merk. "Have 'em with
us. Great. More convent kids the merrier. Invite
their chaperon, too. I'll get Mrs. Hoppen.
Hen-party of six."</p>

<p>I hesitated. Mrs. George Morgan would hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
approve of Mollie Merk, but she would find her a
new type. Mrs. Morgan liked new types and
strange experiences, and had seen many of them,
for her husband was a wealthy Chicago man who
wrote plays. Moreover, Mrs. Hoppen would be
with us, and Mrs. Morgan would surely like her.
Mrs. Hoppen was the city editor's star woman reporter,
and very old&mdash;older even than Mollie Merk,
who was at least twenty-five. Mrs. Hoppen, I had
heard, was over thirty. She was rather bitter and
blasé at times, but usually she had charming manners.
I told Miss Merk I would get Mrs. Morgan
on the telephone and ask if she and the girls could
come, and within five minutes I was in the <i>Searchlight's</i>
telephone-booth calling up her hotel.</p>

<p>It was Maudie Joyce who answered, and she uttered
a cry of joy when I told her of Mollie Merk's
invitation. She said Mrs. Morgan had gone to bed
with a sick-headache, and that she and Kittie James
had been just about sick, too, over the prospect of
a whole evening shut up alone in hotel rooms when
so much Life was going to waste in the outer world.
Then she turned from the telephone and repeated
Mollie's message. I observed that she did not say
anything about the dinner being Bohemian and
making our eyes stick out, though I had faithfully
repeated our hostess's words. Almost immediately
her voice, breathless with joy, came over the wire
again, telling me that she and Kittie could dine with
us, and that Mrs. Morgan was very grateful to Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Merk for saving her young friends from a lonely
evening.</p>

<p>The girls were waiting when we three reached the
hotel, and my heart swelled with pride as I introduced
them. Mrs. Hoppen and Mollie Merk and
I were, of course, in our office clothes, as we had not
gone home to dress; but Kittie and Maudie were
beautifully gowned for the evening. They were
both as charming as Helleu drawings, and in the
same exquisitely finished way; and their manners
were so perfect that I could almost hear Mollie Merk
trying to climb up to them. By the time the five
of us had crowded into the taxi-cab, with the little
bustle and confusion the effort caused, everybody
liked everybody else. Maudie and Kittie were very
proud of being with three newspaper women, and
showed it; and they were so fascinated by Mollie
Merk that they could not keep their eyes off her.</p>

<p>Of course, too, they were quivering with delight
over the throngs, the noise, the brilliant electric
signs, the excitement on every side, and the feeling
that they were in the midst of it. Even I, though
I had been in New York for a whole month and was
a reporter at that, felt an occasional thrill. But as
I leaned back and watched the faces of my two
friends, I realized that, though we three were about
the same age, in experience I was already a thousand
years in advance of them. So many things had
happened in the past month&mdash;things we girls at St.
Catharine's had never heard of&mdash;things I could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
even mention to Kittie and Maudie. I felt that I
had lost a great deal which they still retained, and
I expected a deep sadness to settle upon my soul.
But someway it did not.</p>

<p>The cab stopped at a restaurant ornamented by
a huge electric sign, and we got out and walked into
a marble-lined vestibule. Mollie Merk and Mrs.
Hoppen led the way, and I followed them with an
easy, accustomed step. To dine at a great New
York restaurant was just as novel to me as it was to
Maudie and Kittie, but they did not know this, and
I sincerely hoped they would not find it out.</p>

<p>A maid took our wraps in the anteroom, and sent
us in single file along a narrow hall to enter a huge
room at the end of it, ablaze with electric light, and
full of smoke and music and little tables with people
sitting at them. All the tables were clustered close
together around the four sides of the room, leaving
a big square space in the center, roped off by a
heavy red cord. It was empty, and I wondered
what it was for. Above there was a balcony with
more tables and people at them. There was laughter
everywhere, some of it quite loud, and many voices
were speaking in many tongues. Above it all the
band at the head of the room poured forth gay
music. I could hear Maudie and Kittie draw quick
breaths of delight, and my own feet hardly touched
the ground as we followed the head waiter to the
table reserved for us.</p>

<p>There were bottles and glasses on most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
tables, and even the women were helping to empty
them. But I knew that many good people drink
wine in moderation, so I was not greatly shocked.
After all, this was New York&mdash;Bohemia, a new
world. We were in it, and I at least was of it. The
reflection sent a thrill down my spine&mdash;the kind
that goes all the way. I felt almost wicked, and
strangely happy.</p>

<p>When we were seated at our table Mollie Merk
asked if we would have cocktails. She spoke with a
very casual air, and we tried to decline in the same
manner, though I am sure that Maudie and Kittie
felt their hair rise then and there. Even my own
scalp prickled. I explained in an offhand way that
we never drank anything but water, so Mollie Merk
ordered some Apollinaris for us, and two cocktails
"with a dash of absinthe in them" for Mrs. Hoppen
and herself. For five minutes afterward Kittie and
Maudie and I did not speak. We were stunned
by the mere sound of that fatal word.</p>

<p>Mollie Merk seemed to understand our emotions,
for she began to tell us about her first experience
with absinthe, years ago, in Paris, when she drank
a large gobletful as if it had been a glass of lemonade.
She said it was the amount a Frenchman would
spend an entire afternoon over, sipping it a few
drops at a time at a little sidewalk table in front of
some cafe; but that she gulped it down in a few
swallows, and then had just enough intelligence left
to get into a cab and tell the <i>cocher</i> to drive her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
around for three hours. She said she had ordered
the man to keep to the Boulevards, but that he had
taken her through the Milky Way and to the places
where the morning stars sang together, and that
she had distinctly heard them sing. Afterward,
she added, she had traveled for centuries through
space, visiting the most important objects in the
universe and admiring color effects, for everything
was pulsing with purple and gold and amethyst
lights.</p>

<p>As a student of Life I admired the unerring instinct
with which Mollie Merk had chosen her subject
when she started in to make our eyes stick out.
But if this was the beginning, what would be the
end? At last Maudie Joyce, who had always had
the manner of a woman of the world, even when
she was a school-girl, pulled herself together and
asked smilingly if Miss Merk's cocktail had swept
her into space this time. Mollie Merk sighed and
said, alas, no; those were the joys of yesteryear,
and that the most a cocktail could do for her at
present was to make her forget her depression after
she had received a letter from home. Then a calcium
light blazed from above, making a brilliant circle
on the floor inside the red ropes. The musicians
struck into wild Oriental music, and two mulattoes
came into the limelight and began to dance.</p>

<p>They were a man and a woman, very young, and
in evening dress. They padded into the ring like
two black panthers, the woman first, circling slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
around in time to the music, which was soft and
rather monotonous, and the man revolving slowly
after her. At first she seemed not to see him, but
to be dancing by herself, for the love of it, and
there was beauty in every movement she made. I
forgot all about the dinner, the people, my friends
and my hostess, and leaned forward, watching.</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked over her shoulder and discovered
the man. She quickened her steps a little,
and the musicians played faster, while she circled
in and out, as if through the tangled growths of some
dense jungle. I could almost see it springing up
around her and hear the sound of animals moving
near her&mdash;wild things like herself. She was very
sure of herself as she writhed and twisted, and she
had reason to be; for, however fast the man came
toward her, she was always a little in advance of
him. The music swelled into a sudden crash of
sound as he gave a leap and caught her. But she
dipped and slipped out of his hands and whirled
away again, sometimes crouching close to the ground,
sometimes revolving around him with a mocking
smile. Once, as he leaped, she bent and let him go
over her; again he caught her, but a second time
she slipped away.</p>

<p>At last the violins sent forth only a queer, muted,
barbaric hum, broken by a crash of cymbals as the
man made his final spring and captured the woman,
this time holding her fast. There was a delirious
whirl of sound and motion while he held her up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
performed a kind of jungle <i>pas seule</i> before he carried
her away. The music grew slower and slower and
finally stopped; but for an instant or two after the
dancers had disappeared it seemed to me that I
could still see the man bearing his burden steadily
through strange tropical growths and under trees
whose poisonous branches caught at him as he passed.</p>

<p>I turned and looked at Maudie and Kittie. They
were sitting very still, with their eyes fixed on the
spot where the dancers had been. I knew what they
were thinking, and they knew I knew; but when
they caught my glance they both began to speak
at once, and eagerly, as if to reassure me. Maudie
said the woman's clothes were in excellent taste,
and Kittie murmured that such violent exercise must
be very reducing. Kittie is extremely plump, and
she loves good food so much that she is growing
plumper all the time. In her interest in the dance
she had forgotten her dinner, and now the waiter
was taking away a portion of salmon with a delicious
green sauce before she had eaten even a mouthful
of it. That agonizing sight immediately diverted
Kittie's mind, and I was glad.</p>

<p>Mollie Merk met my startled eyes and grinned.
"Cheer up, Iverson!" she exclaimed. "Worst's yet
to come, you know."</p>

<p>I managed to smile back at her. This was Life,
and we were seeing it, but I began to feel that we
had seen enough for an evening. I tried to remind
myself again that we were in Bohemia, but under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the look in Maudie's eyes I felt my face grow hot.
It was I who had brought her and Kittie here&mdash;I
and my new friends. What would Sister Irmingarde
think of me if she knew?</p>

<p>I had little time for such mournful reflections.
There was a stir on the musicians' platform as all
the players but one laid aside their instruments and
filed out through a side door. This one, the first
violin, came down on the floor and walked about
among the diners, stopping at different tables.
Every time he stopped, I discovered, it was to play
to some particular woman who had caught his eye.
He was tall and good-looking in his gipsy costume,
with a wide red sash around his waist, a white-silk
shirt open at the neck, short velvet trousers, and a
black-velvet coat. Under his dark mustache his
teeth looked very white as he smiled, and he smiled
often, or sighed and made eyes at the women as he
played to them.</p>

<p>I glanced at Kittie and Maudie. They were watching
the gipsy with absorbed interest.</p>

<p>He must have caught Maudie's eye, for suddenly
he crossed to our table and began to play to her&mdash;turning
occasionally to Kittie and me for a second
only, while his violin shrieked and moaned and
sighed and sang in a way that made our hearts
turn over. I could see by their faces, which were
pink with excitement, and by their shining eyes,
what emotions the moment held for my young friends,
and certainly it was thrilling enough for three girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
just out of school to have a genius playing to them
alone in one of the gayest restaurants in New
York.</p>

<p>For a few moments I was delighted with the
gipsy and his music. Then I began to notice the
way he looked at us, alternately half-closing and
slowly opening his eyes as he put his soul into his
music. He seemed to be immensely interested in
Maudie, and played to her much longer than he did
to any one else. Several times he came so close to
her that I was afraid he would touch her.</p>

<p>The other musicians had returned by this time,
and were playing an accompaniment to the violinist,
who had swung into a Brahms waltz. When he
had finished the first movement he stopped playing,
tucked his violin under his arm, and held out his
hand to Maudie, with his most brilliant smile. She
turned first red, then white, and shrank away from
him in her chair, while instinctively I, too, threw
out my hands to ward him off. He turned to me and
took them at once, holding them tight and trying
to pull me to my feet. My heart stopped beating
as I resisted his drag on my wrists, and I looked at
Mollie Merk and Mrs. Hoppen, expecting them to
spring up and interfere. But for a moment they
both sat regarding the scene as indifferently as if
they were at a play.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Hoppen shook her head at the musician
with her bored little smile, and he bowed and
shrugged his shoulders and went off to a table some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
distance away, where he began to play to another
woman.</p>

<p>Mollie Merk leaned toward me. "Say, Iverson,"
she exclaimed, in a tone that must have reached the
diners in the balcony, "what's up? You're as white
as your copy-paper. Which is it&mdash;indigestion or
cold feet?"</p>

<p>Her words pulled me together. It was natural
that I should look pale, for by this time I was
frightened&mdash;not for myself, but for Kittie and
Maudie. They, I could see, though embarrassed and
ill at ease, were not yet frightened. I knew why. <i>I</i>
was there, and they trusted me. They were sure
that nothing could harm them while I was with
them. I set my teeth in the determination that
nothing should.</p>

<p>More entertainers came into the space shut off
by the red cords. Every moment the room grew
closer and hotter, the smoke around us became
thicker, the atmosphere of excitement increased.
The faces of Kittie and Maudie began to float
before me in a kind of mist. I decided that if I ever
got them out into a clean world again I would have
nothing left to pray for. But I knew I could not
wipe the evening and its incidents from their memories,
and that knowledge was the hardest thing I
had to bear.</p>

<p>In desperation I turned from the dancers and
began to watch the diners. The way these accepted
the dancing and the actions of the gipsy had shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
me at once what they were, and now they were
becoming gayer every minute and more noisy.
Some of them got up occasionally and whirled about
together on the dancing-floor. Many sang accompaniments
to the violins. These men and women
were moths, I reflected, whirling about a lurid flame
of life. There were dozens of young girls in the
room&mdash;many without chaperons.</p>

<p>Directly opposite me two persons&mdash;a man, and
a girl in a white dress&mdash;sat at a table alone, absorbed
in each other. At first I glanced at them only
occasionally and idly, then with growing interest
and at last with horror, for I began to understand.
The girl had a sweet, good face, but a brief study
of the man showed me what he was. He was short
and stout, with a bald head and a round, pleasure-loving
face. It was not so much his appearance,
however, as the way he watched the girl which
betrayed him to me. He hardly took his eyes from
her face. Whatever was going on in the dancing-place,
he looked at her; and she, leaning a little
forward in her chair, listened to him as he talked,
and swayed toward him. I saw him tap her hand,
which lay on the table, with his fat forefinger. The
sight revolted me, but she did not draw her hand
away.</p>

<p>As I watched her I thought of all the dreadful
things I had heard and read and seen since I had
been in New York, and wondered if the time would
ever come when I would be old enough and wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
enough to rise and go to a girl in such a situation
and ask her if she needed help. It seemed impossible
that women experienced enough to do this
with dignity and courage should sit around to-night,
all unheeding, and let such things go on. Then looking
at them again, table by table, I read the answer.
They were themselves the lost and strayed&mdash;callous,
indifferent, with faces and hearts hardened
by the lives they had led. I began to feel sick and
faint, and for a moment I closed my eyes.</p>

<p>When I opened them, coming toward us slowly
through the crowd was Godfrey Morris, the assistant
of Nestor Hurd, my chief on the <i>Searchlight</i>. It
was plain that he had just entered, for he was
looking around in search of a table. I shall never forget
the feeling that came over me when I recognized
him. Now that he was there, I felt absolutely safe.
I had almost a vision of him picking up Maudie
and Kittie and me and taking us bodily away, and
the relief and gratitude I felt showed me how great
my inward panic had been. I kept my eyes on him,
hoping he would turn and see me, but he was looking
in another direction. Still, he was drawing nearer,
and I sat tight and waited in silence, though I wanted
to call out to him above the uproar around us.</p>

<p>It did not surprise me to see the girl in white put
out her hand as he passed her table and touch him
on the arm. He stopped at once, looking a little
surprised, and then stood for a moment beside her
and the stout man, talking quietly to them both.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
I waited breathlessly. Now he was speaking to
the man alone, probably urging him to leave the
place. And then&mdash;I heard a sound as unexpected
in that place as an altar-bell. Mr. Morris had thrown
back his head and laughed, and as he laughed he
smote the stout man heavily on the shoulder and
dropped into a chair beside him. The stout man
filled a glass. I saw Mr. Morris lift it, bow to the
girl in white, and drink its contents.</p>

<p>I lived a long, long time during the next minute.
I cannot describe my emotions. I only knew that
in that instant life seemed unbearable and New
York became a city I could not remain in any longer.
Surely nothing could be right in a place where even
Godfrey Morris came to resorts like this, not as a
knight to the rescue of helplessness, but as a familiar
patron, who was there because he enjoyed it and
found congenial friends.</p>

<p>It was impossible to take my eyes from the horrible
group at that table. I kept on staring, and,
as if he felt my gaze, Mr. Morris turned around and
saw me. The next instant he was on his feet, and
a second after that he was shaking hands with Mrs.
Hoppen and Mollie Merk and me. Evidently, he
was neither surprised to find us there nor ashamed
to be found there himself. When he was presented
to Kittie and Maudie his manner was exactly as it
might have been if he were meeting them at an
afternoon tea, and he settled down comfortably into
the sixth place at our table, which Mrs. Morgan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
had been invited to fill, and chatted as if he had
known the girls all his life.</p>

<p>I have no idea what he said. It did not matter.
After the first few moments Maudie and Kittie
were able to talk to him. I heard their voices, but
not their words. I sat with my eyes on the table-cloth
and my cheeks burning. I wanted to get away
that minute. I wanted to go to my home, out West.
Most of all, I wanted to return to the convent and
never, never leave it.</p>

<p>The gipsy was playing among the tables again,
and now he was quite near us. But I had reached
the point where I was not even interested when he
turned, caught sight of our new companion, and
crossed quickly to our table, his hand outstretched
to Mr. Morris, his face shining like an electric globe
when the light has been turned on inside of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris greeted him like a long-lost brother.
"Hello, Fritz!" he exclaimed, taking his hand in a
most friendly grasp. "Business good? How are
the kids?"</p>

<p>The gipsy revealed the widest smile of the evening
as he answered. "<i>Ach</i>, Herr Morris," he cried,
in a guttural German voice that simply dripped
affection, "you remember dose kids? T'ree we had&mdash;<i>aber</i>
now, <i>now</i> we got anoder one&mdash;since Tuesday!"</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Mr. Morris, looking around as if
he expected us all to share his joy over the glad
tidings. "Girl or boy?"</p>

<p>"Girl," the gipsy player told him. "T'ree boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
we had. Now we haf girl for change. We t'ink,
my wife and I, we make her noospaper woman.
Goot idea, <i>nicht wahr</i>?"</p>

<p>He laughed, and Mr. Morris laughed with him.
"Fine," he declared. "Send her down to the <i>Searchlight</i>
office in a week or two. We'll give her Miss
Merk's job."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed again, Mollie Merk, of course,
loudest of all. The musician bade us good night,
beginning to play again at the tables. I had forgotten
about Kittie and Maudie, but now I knew
they had been listening, too, for I heard Kittie speak.</p>

<p>"Why, that gipsy isn't a gipsy at all, is he?"
she gasped.</p>

<p>"No more than I am," Mollie Merk told her.
"Wears the rig because it pays&mdash;pleases romantic
girls." She grinned at us, while Mrs. Hoppen leaned
forward.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you hurt his feelings," she told
Maudie and me, "by refusing his invitation to
dance a little while ago. That was the greatest
compliment he could pay you, you know."</p>

<p>Mr. Morris looked amused. "Did he invite them
to dance?" he inquired, with interest. "Good old
Fritz. He doesn't often do that, this season."</p>

<p>Maudie and I exchanged a long glance. "I
thought&mdash;" Maudie began, and then stopped. I
was glad she said no more. I looked again at the
gipsy, and, as if something had been stripped from
my eyes, I saw him as he was&mdash;no reckless and desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
adventurer, but a matter-of-fact German,
his silk shirt rather grimy, his black hair oily, his
absurd red sash and shabby velvet coat rebukes to
the imagination that had pictured a wild gipsy
heart beating under them.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris was smiling at the girl in white. Now
he turned to me and nodded toward her. "That's
Miss Hastings and George Brook," he said. "Have
you met them yet?" I was able to shake my head.
"Well, it's high time you did," were his next words.
"I'll bring them over."</p>

<p>He rose, but I caught his arm and gasped out
something that stopped him. I don't remember
what I said, but I succeeded in making him understand
that I did not want that particular man to
meet my friends. Mr. Morris stared at me hard
for a moment. Then he sat down again and looked
me straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Miss Iverson," he said, quietly, "what have you
against Brook? He's the foreign editor of the
<i>Searchlight</i>, and one of the best fellows alive."</p>

<p>I could not speak. I was too much surprised.</p>

<p>"The girl he's with," Morris went on, "is Marion
Hastings&mdash;Mrs. Cartwell's social secretary. She
and Brook are going to be married next week."</p>

<p>He waited for me to reply. I muttered something
about not wanting my friends to meet any one
in this place. That was all I said. My self-control,
my poise, had deserted me, but perhaps my burning
face was more eloquent than my tongue. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Morris looked from me to Maudie, and then at
Kittie, and finally back at me.</p>

<p>"I see," he said at last, very slowly. "You three
actually think you are in a den of iniquity!"</p>

<p>He turned to Mollie Merk and addressed her as
crisply and with as much authority as if they were
in the <i>Searchlight</i> office.</p>

<p>"How did you come to give Miss Iverson that
impression?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Mollie Merk looked guilty. "Didn't realize she
had it till within the last half-hour," she muttered.</p>

<p>"I see," said Morris again, in the same tone.
"And then it was such fun for you that you let it
go on!"</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Merk seemed inclined to sulk.
Then she threw herself back in her chair and laughed.
"Oh, well," she admitted, "'twas fun. Know what
started her. Said something about showing her Life&mdash;making
her eyes stick out. Adding her friends to
the party changed the program. Brought 'em here
instead. Seeing us drink cocktails started her panic.
Harlem tango did the rest. Her imagination got
busy."</p>

<p>I listened to her as one listens to a strange tongue
in which one hears an occasional familiar word.
She turned to me. "What that dance represents,"
she said, "is a suburbanite catching a cook. Least,
that's what the inventor says."</p>

<p>"It's very graceful. My nieces dance it charmingly,"
Mrs. Hoppen added, mildly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Morris smiled, but not as if he really wanted
to. Then he turned to me. There was a beautiful,
understanding look in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you realize what has happened, Miss Iverson?"
he asked. "You've been having a bad dream.
You expected something lurid, so you have seen
something lurid in everything you have looked at
to-night. In reality you are in one of the most
eminently correct restaurants in New York. Of
course it has its <i>cabaret</i>&mdash;most of them have, this
season&mdash;but it's an extremely well-conducted and
conservative one, with no objectionable features
whatever. Now look around you and try to see
things as they are."</p>

<p>He made a gesture with his hand, and I followed
it slowly around the room. At most of the tables
ordinary-looking couples sat contentedly munching
food. A German woman near us was telling a friend
how she cooked <i>Wiener Schnitzel</i>. A tired-looking
girl was doing an acrobatic dance in the ring, but
it was not vulgar. It was merely foolish and dull.
Three men on our left were arguing over some business
question and adding up penciled columns on
the table-cloth. Our wild-hearted gipsy, Fritz, was
having a glass of beer with some friends off in a
corner. The musicians were playing "The Rosary,"
and several fat women were lost in mournful memories.
Not far away a waiter dropped a tray and
broke some glasses, and the head waiter hastened
to him and swore under his breath. That was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
only lurid thing in the room, and it was mild indeed
to ears familiar with the daily conversation
of Mr. Hurd and Colonel Cartwell. Everything
else suddenly, unmistakably, was simple, cheerful,
entirely proper, and rather commonplace.</p>

<p>"So much for the restaurant," remarked Mr. Morris,
smiling as if he had observed my change of
expression. "Now for the people. That's the editor
of the <i>Argus</i> over there"&mdash;he pointed to a thin,
blond man&mdash;"with his daughters. At the table
next to them is Miss Blinn, the artist. The stout
old lady who is eating too much is her mother. The
chap with the white hair is the leading editorial-writer
of the <i>Modern Review</i>, and the lady opposite
is his sister. Almost every one prominent in New
York drops into this place at one time or another.
Many worthy citizens come regularly. It's quite
the thing, though dull!"</p>

<p>"I know," I stammered. "I know." I did know,
but I was humiliated to the soul. "Please don't
say any more."</p>

<p>It is true that I form impressions quickly. It is
also true that I can change them just as quickly
when I am shown that I am wrong. Mr. Morris
looked at my face, from which the blood now seemed
to be bursting, and took pity on me.</p>

<p>"All I want," he ended, "is to make you realize
that you're visiting a legitimate place of amusement
and that the performers are honest, hard-working
people, though I think myself they're going a bit stale."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"Been doing the same thing too long," corroborated
Mollie Merk. "Garroti ought to change his
program. Just the same," she added, cheerfully, as
she called the waiter and paid the bill, "they give
you the best <i>table d'hôte</i> dinner in town. If you
hadn't been too scared to eat, Iverson, you'd have
realized that much, anyway!"</p>

<p>At this, Kittie James broke into the conversation.
Here was something Kittie understood, though, like
myself, she had been somewhat mixed as to the
place and the performers. Kittie told Mollie Merk
with impassioned earnestness that the dinner was
one of the best she had ever eaten, and that she
would never forget the flavor of the artichoke hearts
with the mushrooms on them. Mollie Merk seemed
pleased and patted Kittie's hand.</p>

<p>"You see," she went on, addressing the others as
if I were not there, "Iverson's had a pretty hard
time since she struck this town. It's jolted her
sense of values. Thought everything was white.
Had some unpleasant experiences. Decided everything
was black. Been seeing black to-night. Take
another month or two," she added, kindly, turning
to me, "to discover most things are merely gray."</p>

<p>Those were her words. It was a moment of agony
for me. I had now gone down into the abyss of
humiliation and struck the bottom hard. Mr. Morris
spoke to me, though at first I did not hear him.</p>

<p>"Don't forget one thing, Miss Iverson," he said,
gently. "An imagination like yours is the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
asset a writer can have. You'll appreciate it when
you begin work on your novels and plays in a year
or two."</p>

<p>I felt a little better. I could see that Maudie and
Kittie were impressed.</p>

<p>We drifted out into the street, toward a row of
waiting taxi-cabs. There Mrs. Hoppen and Mollie
Merk bade us good night, and Mr. Morris put
Maudie and Kittie and me into a taxi-cab and got
in after us. His manner was beautiful&mdash;serious,
sympathetic, and deeply respectful. On the way to
the hotel he told them what good work I was doing,
and about the "model story" I had written two
weeks before. I was glad he spoke of those things.
I was afraid they had discovered that, after all, there
were still many lessons in life I had not learned.</p>

<p>After I had gone up to my room I went to one
of the windows facing Madison Square and looked
out. It was not late&mdash;hardly eleven o'clock, and
the big city below was wide awake and hard at play.
Many sad and terrible things were happening in it,
but I knew that many kind and beautiful things
were happening, too. I felt sure that hereafter I
would always be able to tell them apart.</p>

<p>Later, when I closed my eyes, all sorts of pictures
crowded upon me. I saw the mulatto dancer pursuing
the Harlem cook. I heard again Fritz's wild
gipsy music and saw him wandering among the
tables. I saw the stout man and the girl in white, and
felt my face burn as I recalled what I had thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
of them. But the thing I saw most clearly, the
thing that followed me into the land of dreams and
drifted about there till morning, was the face of
Godfrey Morris, with a look of sympathy and understanding
in his gray eyes.</p>

<h2>V<br />

<span class="s08">THE CASE OF HELEN BRANDOW</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
"'S Iverson," barked Nestor Hurd, over the
low partition which divided his office from
that of his staff, "c'm' here!"</p>

<p>I responded to his call with sympathetic haste.
It had been a hard day for Mr. Hurd. Everything
had gone wrong. Every reporter he had sent out
seemed to be "falling down" on his assignment and
telephoning in to explain why. Next to failures,
our chief disliked explanations. "A dead man
doesn't care a hang what killed him," was his terse
summing up of their futility.</p>

<p>He was shouting an impassioned monologue into
the telephone when I reached his side, and as a
final exclamation-point he hurled the receiver down
on his desk, upsetting a bottle of ink. I waited in
silence while he exhausted the richest treasures of
his vocabulary and soaked up the ink with blotters.
It was a moment for feminine tact, and I exercised
it, though I was no longer in awe of Mr. Hurd. I
had been on the <i>Searchlight</i> a year, and the temperamental
storms of my editors now disturbed me
no more than the whirling and buzzing of mechanical
tops. Even Mollie Merk had ceased to call me the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
"convent kid." I had made many friends, learned
many lessons, suffered many disappointments, lost
many illusions, and taken on some new ones. I had
slowly developed a sense of humor&mdash;to my own abysmal
surprise. The memory of my convent had become
as the sound of a vesper-bell, heard occasionally
above the bugle-calls of a strenuous life. Also, I
had learned to avoid "fine writing," which is why
my pen faltered just now over the "bugle-calls."
I knew my men associates very well, and admired
most of them, though they often filled me with a
maternal desire to stand them in a corner with their
faces to the wall. I frequently explained to them
what their wives or sweethearts really meant by
certain things they had said. I was the recognized
office authority on good form, Catholicism, and
feminine psychology. Therefore I presented to Mr.
Hurd's embittered glance the serene brow of an equal&mdash;even
on occasions such as this, when the peace of
the office lay in fragments around us.</p>

<p>At last he ceased to address space, threw the
blotters into his waste-paper basket, and turned
resentful eyes on me.</p>

<p>"Gibson's fallen down on the Brandow case," he
snapped.</p>

<p>I uttered a coo of sympathy.</p>

<p>"The woman won't talk," continued Hurd, gloomily.
"Don't believe she'll talk to any one if she
won't to Gibson. But we'll give her 'nother chance.
Go 'n' see her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>I remained silent.</p>

<p>"You've followed the trial, haven't you?" Mr.
Hurd demanded. "What d'you think of the
case?"</p>

<p>I murmured apologetically that I thought Mrs.
Brandow was innocent, and the remark produced
exactly the effect I had expected. My chief gave
me one look of unutterable scorn and settled back
in his chair.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" he groaned. "So you've joined
the sobbing sisterhood at last! I wouldn't have
believed it. 'S Iverson"&mdash;his voice changed, he
brought his hand down on the desk with a force
that made the ink-bottle rock&mdash;"that woman's as
guilty as&mdash;as&mdash;"</p>

<p>I reminded him that the evidence against Mrs.
Brandow was purely circumstantial.</p>

<p>"Circumstantial? 'Course it's circumstantial!"
yelped Hurd. "She's too clever to let it be anything
else. She has hidden every track. She's the slickest
proposition we've had up for murder in this state,
and she's young, pretty, of good family&mdash;so she'll
probably get off. But she killed her husband as
surely as you stand there, and the fact that he was
a brute and deserved what he got doesn't make her
any less guilty of his murder."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for Mr. Hurd. He seemed
surprised by it himself, and stopped to glare at me
as if I were to blame for the effort it had caused
him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"You know Davies, her lawyer, don't you?" he
asked, more quietly.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>"Think he'll give you a letter to her?"</p>

<p>I thought he would.</p>

<p>"'L right," snapped Mr. Hurd. "Go 'n' see her.
If she'll talk, get an interview. If she won't, describe
her and her cell. Tell how she looks and what
she wears&mdash;from the amount of hair over her ears
to the kind of polish on her shoes. Leave mawkish
sympathy out of it. See her as she is&mdash;a murderess
whose trial is going to make American justice look
like a hole in a doughnut."</p>

<p>I went back to my desk thinking of his words.
While I was pinning on my hat the door of Mr.
Hurd's room opened and shut, and his assistant,
Godfrey Morris, came and stood beside me.</p>

<p>"I don't want to butt in," he began, "but&mdash;I
hope you're going on this assignment with an open
mind, Miss Iverson."</p>

<p>That hurt me. For some reason it always hurt
me surprisingly to have Godfrey Morris show any
lack of faith in me in any way.</p>

<p>"I told Mr. Hurd," I answered, with dignity,
"that I think Mrs. Brandow is innocent. But my
opinion won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know." Mr. Morris's ability to interrupt a
speaker without seeming rude was one of his special
gifts. "Hurd thinks she's guilty," he went on.
"I think she's innocent. What I hope you'll do is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
to forget what any one thinks. Go to the woman
without prejudice one way or the other. Write of
her as you find her."</p>

<p>"That," I said, "is precisely what I intend to do."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Morris. "I was afraid that
what Hurd said might send you out with the wrong
notion."</p>

<p>He strolled with me toward the elevator. "I
never knew a case where the evidence for and against
a prisoner was so evenly balanced," he mused. "I'm
for her simply because I can't believe that a woman
with her brains and courage would commit such a
crime. She's too good a sport! By Jove, the way
she went through that seven-hour session on the
witness-stand the other day ..." He checked himself.
"Oh, well," he ended, easily, "I'm not her advocate.
She may be fooling us all. Good-by. Get
a good story."</p>

<p>"I'll make her confess to me," I remarked, cheerfully,
at the elevator door. "Then we'll suppress
the confession!"</p>

<p>"We'll give her a square deal, anyway," he called,
as the elevator began to descend.</p>

<p>It was easy to run out to Fairview, the scene of
the trial, easy to get the letter from Mr. Davies, and
easiest of all to interview the friendly warden of
the big prison and send the note to Mrs. Brandow
in her cell when she had returned from court. After
that the broad highway of duty was no longer
oiled. Very courteously, but very firmly, too, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Brandow declined to see me. Many messages passed
between us before I was admitted to her presence
on the distinct understanding that I was not to ask
her questions, that I was not to quote anything she
might say; that, in short, I was to confine the drippings
of my gifted pen to a description of her environment
and of herself. This was not a heartening
task. Yet when the iron door of Number 46
on the women's tier of the prison had swung back
to admit me my first glance at the prisoner and her
background showed me that Mr. Hurd would have
at least one "feature" for the <i>Searchlight</i> the next
morning.</p>

<p>On either side of Number 46 were typical white-painted
and carbolic-scented cells&mdash;one occupied
by an intoxicated woman who snored raucously on
her narrow cot, the other by a wretched hag who
clung to the bars of her door with filthy fingers
and leered at me as I passed. Between the two was
a spot as out of place in those surroundings as a
flower-bed would seem on the stern brow of an
Alpine glacier.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brandow, the newspapers had told the world,
was not only a beautiful woman, but a woman who
loved beauty. She had spent six months in Fairview
awaiting her trial. All the members of the "good
family" Mr. Hurd had mentioned had died young&mdash;probably
as a reward of their excellence. She had
no intimate friends&mdash;her husband, it was said, had
made friendships impossible for her. Nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
first with one trifle, then with another, brought to
her by the devoted maid who had been with her for
years, she had made herself a home in her prison.</p>

<p>Tacked on the wall, facing her small, white-painted
iron bed, was a large piece of old Java print,
its colors dimmed by time to dull browns and blues.
On the bed itself was a cover of blue linen, and the
cement floor was partly concealed by a Chinese rug
whose rich tones harmonized with those of the print.
Over the bed hung a fine copy of a Hobbema, in
which two lines of trees stretched on and on toward
a vague, far-distant horizon. Near this a large
framed print showed a great stretch of Scotch
moors and wide, empty skies. A few silver-backed
toilet articles lay on a small glass-covered hospital
table. Against this unlooked-for background the
suspected murderess, immaculate in white linen
tailor-made garments, sat on a white-enameled
stool, peacefully sewing a button on a canvas shoe.</p>

<p>The whole effect was so unprecedented, even to
me after a year of the varied experiences which
come to a New York reporter, that my sense of the
woman's situation was wiped out by the tableau
she made. Without intending to smile at all, I
smiled widely as I entered and held out my hand;
and Mrs. Brandow, who had risen to receive me,
sent back an answering smile, cool, worldly, and
understanding.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a cozy domestic scene, isn't it?" she asked,
lightly, reading my thoughts, "but on too small a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
scale. We're a trifle cramped. Take the stool. I
will sit on the bed."</p>

<p>She moved the stool an inch, with a hospitable
gesture which almost created an effect of space,
and sat down opposite me, taking me in from head
to foot with one straight look from black eyes in
whose depths lurked an odd sparkle.</p>

<p>"You won't mind if I finish this?" she asked, as she
picked up her needle. "I have only two more buttons."</p>

<p>I reassured her, and she bit off a piece of cotton
and rethreaded her needle expertly.</p>

<p>"They won't let me have a pair of scissors," she
explained, as she began to sew. "It's a wonder they
lend me a needle. They tell me it's a special privilege.
Once a week the guard brings it to me at this
hour, and the same evening he retrieves it with a long
sigh of relief. He is afraid I will swallow it and
cheat the electric chair. He needn't be. It isn't
the method I should choose."</p>

<p>Her voice was a soft and warm contralto, whose
vibrations seemed to linger in the air when she had
ceased to speak. Her manner was indescribably
matter-of-fact. She gave a vigorous pull to the button
she had sewed on and satisfied herself of its
strength. Then she bit the thread again and began
to secure the last button, incidentally chatting on,
as she might have chatted to a friend over a cup of
tea.</p>

<p>Very simply and easily, because it was my cue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
but even more because I was immensely interested,
I fell into her mood. We talked a long time and of
many things. She asked about my work, and I gave
her some details of its amusing side. She spoke
of the books she had read and was reading, of places
she had visited, and, in much the same tone, of her
nights in prison, made hideous by her neighbors in
near-by cells. As she talked, two dominating impressions
strengthened in me momentarily: she was the
most immaculate human being I had ever seen,
and the most perfectly poised.</p>

<p>When she had sewed on the last button, fastening
the thread with workman-like deftness, she opened
a box of pipe-clay and whitened both shoes with a
moist sponge.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know why I do all this," she murmured,
casually. "I suppose it's the force of habit.
It's surprising how some habits last and others fall
away. The only wish I have now is that I and my
surroundings may remain decently clean."</p>

<p>"May I quote that?" I asked, tentatively&mdash;"that,
and what you have told me about the books you
are reading?"</p>

<p>Her expression of indifferent tolerance changed.
She regarded me with narrowed eyes under drawn,
black brows. "No," she said, curtly. "You'll be
good enough to keep to your bond. You agreed
not to repeat a word I said."</p>

<p>I rose to go. "And I won't," I told her, "naturally.
But I hoped you had changed your mind."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>She rose also, the slight, ironic smile again playing
about her lips. "No," she answered, in a gentler
tone, "the agreement holds. But I don't wonder
I misled you! I've prattled like a school-girl, and"&mdash;the
smile subtly changed its character&mdash;"do you
know, I've rather enjoyed it. I haven't talked to
any one for months but my maid and my lawyer.
Mary's chat is punctuated by sobs. I'm like a freshly
watered garden when she ends her weekly visits.
And the charms of Mr. Davies's conversation leave
me cold. So this has been"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"a
pleasure," she ended.</p>

<p>We shook hands again. "Thank you," I said,
"and good-by. I hope"&mdash;In my turn I hesitated
an instant, seeking the right words. The odd sparkle
deepened in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she murmured. "You hope&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I hope you will soon be free," I ended simply.</p>

<p>Her eyes held mine for an instant. Then, "Thank
you," she said, and turned away. The guard, who
had waited outside with something of the effect
of a clock about to strike, opened the iron door, and
I passed through.</p>

<p>Late that night, after I had turned in my copy
and received in acknowledgment the grunt which
was Mr. Hurd's highest tribute to satisfactory work,
I sat at my desk still thinking of the Brandow case.
Suddenly the chair beside me creaked as Godfrey
Morris dropped into it.</p>

<p>"Just been reading your Brandow story. Good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
work," he said, kindly. "Without bias, too. What
do you think of the woman now, after meeting her?"</p>

<p>"She's innocent," I repeated, tersely.</p>

<p>"Then she didn't confess?" laughed Morris.</p>

<p>"No," I smiled, "she didn't confess. But if she
had been guilty she might have confessed. She
talked a great deal."</p>

<p>Morris's eyes widened with interest. The day's
work was over, and he was in a mood to be entertained.
"Did she?" he asked. "What did she say?"</p>

<p>I repeated the interview, while he leaned back
and listened, his hands clasped behind his head.</p>

<p>"She <i>was</i> communicative," he reflected, at the end.
"In a mood like that, after months of silence, a
woman will tell anything. As you say, if she had
been guilty she might easily have given herself
away. What a problem it would have put up to
you," he mused, "if she <i>had</i> been guilty and <i>had</i>
confessed! On the one hand, loyalty to the <i>Searchlight</i>&mdash;you'd
have had to publish the news. On the
other hand, sympathy for the woman&mdash;for it would
be you who sent her to the electric chair, or remained
silent and saved her."</p>

<p>He looked at me quizzically. "Which would
you have done?" he asked.</p>

<p>It seemed no problem at all to me, but I gave it
an instant's reflection. "I think you know," I
told him.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I think I do," he agreed. "Just
the same," he rose and started for his desk, "don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
you imagine there isn't a problem in the situation.
There's a big one."</p>

<p>He turned back, struck by a sudden idea. "Why
don't you make a magazine story of it?" he added.
"I believe you can write fiction. Here's your chance.
Describe the confession of the murderess, the mental
struggle of the reporter, her suppression of the
news, and its after-effect on her career."</p>

<p>His suggestion hit me much harder than his problem.
The latter was certainly strong enough for
purposes of fiction.</p>

<p>"Why," I said, slowly, "thank you. I believe I
will."</p>

<p>Before Mr. Morris had closed the door I was
drawing a fresh supply of copy-paper toward me;
before he had left the building I had written the
introduction to my first fiction story; and before
the roar of the presses came up to my ears from the
basement, at a quarter to two in the morning, I
had made on my last page the final cross of the
press-writer and dropped the finished manuscript
into a drawer of my desk. It had been written with
surprising ease. Helen Brandow had entered my
tale as naturally as she would enter a room; and
against the bleak background of her cell I seemed
to see her whole life pass before me like a series of
moving-pictures which my pen raced after and
described.</p>

<p>The next morning found me severely critical as
I read my story. Still, I decided to send it to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
famous novelist I had met a few months before,
who had since then spent some of her leisure in
good-naturedly urging me to "write." I believed
she would tell me frankly what she thought of this
first sprout in my literary garden, and that night,
quite without compunction, I sent it to her. Two
days later I received a letter which I carried around
in my pocket until the precious bit of paper was
almost in rags.</p>

<p>"Your story is a corker," wrote the distinguished
author, whose epistolary style was rather free. "I
experienced a real thrill when the woman confessed.
You have made out a splendid case for her; also
for your reporter. Given all your premises, things
<i>had</i> to happen as they did. Offer the story to Mrs.
Langster, editor of <i>The Woman's Friend</i>. Few
editors have sense, but I think she'll know enough
to take it. I inclose a note to her."</p>

<p>If Mrs. Appleton had experienced a thrill over my
heroine's confession we were more than quits, for I
experienced a dozen thrills over her letter, and long
afterward, when she came back from a visit to England
with new honors thick upon her, I amused her
by describing them. Within twenty-four hours after
receiving her inspiring communication I had wound
my way up a circular staircase that made me feel like
an animated corkscrew, and was humbly awaiting
Mrs. Langster's pleasure in the room next to her
dingy private office. She had read Mrs. Appleton's
note at once, and had sent an office boy to say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
she would receive me in a few minutes. I gladly
waited thirty, for this home of a big and successful
magazine was a new world to me&mdash;and, though it
lacked the academic calm I had associated with the
haunts of literature in the making, everything in it
was interesting, from the ink-spattered desks and
their aloof and busy workers to the recurrent roar
of the elevated trains that pounded past the windows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langster proved to be an old lady, with a
smile of extraordinary sweetness. Looking at her
white hair, and meeting the misty glance of her
near-sighted blue eyes, I felt a depressing doubt of
Mrs. Appleton's wisdom in sending me to her with
a work of fiction which turned on murder. One
instinctively associated Mrs. Langster with organ
recitals, evening service, and afternoon teas in dimly
lighted rooms. But there was an admirable brain
under her silver hair, and I had swift proof of the
keenness of her literary discrimination; for within
a week she accepted my story and sent me a check for
an amount equal to the salary I received for a month
of work. Her letter, and that of Mrs. Appleton, went
to Sister Irmingarde&mdash;was it only a year ago that
I had parted from her and the convent? Then I
framed them side by side and hung them in a place
of honor on my study wall, as a solace in dark hours
and an inspiration in brighter ones. They represented
a literary ladder, on the first rung of which
I was sure I had found firm footing, though the
upper rungs were lost in clouds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Langster allowed my story to mellow for
almost a year before she published it; and in the
long interval Helen Brandow was acquitted, and
disappeared from the world that had known her.</p>

<p>I myself had almost forgotten her, and I had even
ceased to look for my story in the columns of <i>The
Woman's Friend</i>, when one morning I found on my
desk a note from Mr. Hurd. It was brief and cryptic,
for Mr. Hurd's notes were as time-saving as his speech.
It read:</p>

<p class="left45">Pls. rept. immed.<br />
<span class="i6">N. H.</span></p>

<p>Without waiting to remove my hat I entered
Mr. Hurd's office. He was sitting bunched up over
his desk, his eyebrows looking like an intricate pattern
of cross-stitching. Instead of his usual assortment
of newspaper clippings, he held in his hand an
open magazine, which, as I entered, he thrust toward
me.</p>

<p>"Here!" he jerked. "What's this mean?"</p>

<p>I recognized with mild surprise the familiar cover
of <i>The Woman's Friend</i>. A second glance showed me
that the page Mr. Hurd was indicating with staccato
movements of a nervous forefinger bore my name.
My heart leaped.</p>

<p>"Why," I exclaimed, delightedly, "it's my story!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hurd's hand held the magazine against the
instinctive pull I gave it. His manner was unusually
quiet. Unusual, too, was the sudden straight
look of his tired eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Sit down," he said, curtly. "I want to ask you
something."</p>

<p>I sat down, my eyes on the magazine. As Mr.
Hurd held it, I could see the top of one illustration.
It looked interesting.</p>

<p>"See here," Mr. Hurd jerked out. "I'm not going
to beat around the bush. Did you throw us down
on this story?"</p>

<p>I stared at him. For an instant I did not get his
meaning. Then it came to me that possibly I should
have asked his permission to publish any work outside
of the <i>Searchlight</i> columns.</p>

<p>"But," I stammered, "you don't print fiction."</p>

<p>Mr. Hurd tapped the open page with his finger.
The unusual quiet of his manner began to impress
me. "<i>Is</i> it fiction?" he asked. "That's what I
want to know."</p>

<p>Godfrey Morris rose from his desk and came toward
us. Until that instant I had only vaguely realized
that he was in the room.</p>

<p>"Hurd," he said, quickly, "you're in the wrong
pew. Miss Iverson doesn't even know what you're
talking about." He turned to me. "He's afraid,"
he explained, "that Mrs. Brandow confessed to you
in Fairview, and that you threw us down by suppressing
the story."</p>

<p>For an instant I was dazed. Then I laughed.
"Mr. Hurd," I said, "I give you my word that Mrs.
Brandow never confessed anything to me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hurd's knitted brows uncreased. "That's
straight, is it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"That's straight," I repeated.</p>

<p>Hurd dropped the magazine on the floor and
turned to his papers. "'L right," he muttered,
"don't let 't happen 'gain."</p>

<p>Mr. Morris and I exchanged an understanding
smile as I picked up the magazine and left the room.</p>

<p>In the outer room I met Gibson. His grin of
greeting was wide and friendly, his voice low and
interested.</p>

<p>"Read your story last night," he whispered.
"Say, tell me&mdash;<i>did</i> she, really?"</p>

<p>I filled the next five minutes explaining to Gibson.
He looked relieved. "I didn't think there was anything
in it," he said. "That woman's no murderess.
But, say, you made the story read like the real
thing!"</p>

<p>Within the next few days everybody on the
<i>Searchlight</i> staff seemed to have read <i>The Woman's
Friend</i>, and to be taking part in the discussion my
story aroused. Those of my associates who believed
in the innocence of Mrs. Brandow accepted the tale
for what it was&mdash;a work of fiction. Those without
prejudice were inclined to think there was "something
in it," and at least half a dozen who believed
her guilty also firmly believed that I had allowed
an acute and untimely spasm of womanly sympathy
to deprive the <i>Searchlight</i> of "the best and
biggest beat in years." For a few days I remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
pleasantly unconscious of being a storm-center, but
one morning a second summons from Mr. Hurd
opened my eyes to the situation.</p>

<p>"See here!" began that gentleman, rudely. "What
does all this talk mean, anyway? They're saying
now that you and Morris suppressed the Brandow
confession between you. Jim, the elevator-boy,
says he heard you agree to do it."</p>

<p>Godfrey Morris leaped to his feet and came toward
us. "Good Lord, Hurd," he cried, fiercely,
"I believe you're crazy! Why don't you come to
me with this rot, if you're going to notice it, and not
bother Miss Iverson? We joked about a confession,
and I suppose Jim heard us. The joke was what
suggested the magazine story."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>that's</i> no joke." Hurd spoke grudgingly,
as if unwillingly impressed. "Suppose the woman
had confessed," he asked me, suddenly&mdash;"would
you have given us the story?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Certainly not," I admitted.
"You forget that I had agreed not to print a word
she said."</p>

<p>Hurd's expression of uncertainty was so funny
that I laughed. "But she didn't," I added, comfortingly.
"Do you think I'd lie to you?"</p>

<p>"You might." Hurd was in a pessimistic mood.
"To save her, or&mdash;" A rare phenomenon occurred;
he smiled&mdash;all his boyish dimples suddenly revealed&mdash;"to
save Morris from losing his job," he finished,
coolly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>I felt my face grow hot. Morris rushed to the
rescue. "The only thing I regret in this confounded
mess," he muttered, ignoring Hurd's words, "is the
effect on Mrs. Brandow. <i>The Woman's Friend</i> has
half a million readers. They'll all think she's
guilty."</p>

<p>"Good job," said Hurd. "She <i>is</i> guilty!"</p>

<p>"Rot! She's absolutely innocent," replied Morris.
"Why, even the fool jury acquitted her on
the first ballot!"</p>

<p>I left them arguing and slipped away, sick at heart.
In the sudden moment of illumination following
Morris's words it had come to me that the one person
to be considered in the whole episode was the
person of whom I had not thought at all! I had done
Helen Brandow a great wrong. Her case had been
almost forgotten; somewhere she was trying to
build up a new life. I had knocked out the new
foundations.</p>

<p>It was a disturbing reflection, and the events of
the next few days deepened my depression. Several
reviewers commented on the similarity of my
story to the Brandow case. People began to ask
where Mrs. Brandow was, began again to argue the
question of her innocence or her guilt. Efforts were
made to find her hiding-place. The thought of the
injury I had done the unhappy woman became an
obsession. There seemed only one way to exorcise
it, and that was to see or write to my "victim,"
as Hurd jocosely called her, make my confession,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
and have her absolve me, if she would, of
any intent of injury.</p>

<p>On the wings of this inspiration I sought Mr.
Davies, and, putting the situation before him, asked
for his client's address.</p>

<p>"Of course I can't give you her address," he explained,
mildly. "But I'll write to her and tell her
you want it. Yes, yes, with pleasure. I know how
you feel." He smiled reflectively. "She's a wonderful
woman," he added. "Most remarkable
woman I ever met&mdash;strongest soul." He sighed,
then smiled again. "I'll write," he repeated; and
with this I had to be content. I had done all that
I could do. But my nerves began to feel the effect
of the strain upon them, and it was a relief when I
reached my home in Madison Square late one evening
and found Mrs. Brandow waiting for me.</p>

<p>She was sitting in a little reception-room off the
main hall of the building, and as I passed the door
on my way to the elevator she rose and came toward
me. She wore a thick veil, but something in me
recognized her even before I caught the flash of her
eyes through it, and noticed the characteristically
erect poise of the head which every reporter who
saw her had described.</p>

<p>"Mr. Davies said you wanted to talk to me,"
she began, without greeting me. "Here I am. Have
I come at the wrong time?"</p>

<p>I slipped my hand through her arm. "No," was
all I could say. "It was very good of you to come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
at all. I did not expect that." In silence we entered
the elevator and ascended to my floor. As I opened
the door with my latch-key and waited for her to
go in I spoke again. "I can't tell you how much
I've been thinking of you," I said.</p>

<p>She made no reply. We passed through the hall
into my study, and while I turned on the electric
lights she dropped into a big arm-chair beside a
window overlooking the Square, threw back her
veil, and slipped off the heavy furs she wore. As
the lights flashed up we exchanged a swift look.
Little more than a year had passed since our
former meeting, but she seemed many years older
and much less beautiful. There were new lines
about her eyes and mouth, and the black hair over
her temples was growing gray. I started to draw
down the window-shades, for it was snowing hard,
and the empty Square below, with a few tramps
shivering on its benches, afforded but a dreary vista.
She checked me.</p>

<p>"Leave them as they are," she directed, imperiously,
adding as an afterthought: "Please. I like
to be able to look out."</p>

<p>I obeyed, realizing now, as I had not done before,
what those months of confinement must have meant
to her. When I had removed my hat and coat, and
lit the logs that lay ready in my big fireplace, I took
a chair near her.</p>

<p>"First of all," I began, "I want to thank you for
coming. And then&mdash;I want to beg your forgiveness."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment she studied me in silence. "That's
rather odd of you," she murmured, reflectively.
"You know I'm fair game! Why shouldn't you run
with the pack?"</p>

<p>My eyes, even my head, went down before that.
For a moment I could not reply. Then it seemed
to me that the most important thing in the world
was to make her understand.</p>

<p>"Of course," I admitted, "I deserve anything
you say. I did a horrible thing when I printed that
story. I should never have offered it to an editor.
My defense is simply that I didn't realize what I
was doing. That's what I want to make clear to
you. That's why I asked to see you."</p>

<p>"I see," she said, slowly. "It's not the story
you're apologizing for. It's the effect."</p>

<p>"Yes," I explained, eagerly, "it's the effect. I
hadn't been out of school more than a year when I
came to you in Fairview," I hurried on. "I was very
young, and appallingly ignorant. It never occurred
to me that any one would connect a fiction story
with&mdash;with your case."</p>

<p>She looked at me, and with all the courage I could
summon I gazed straight back into her strange, deep
eyes. For a long instant the look held, and during
it something came to me, something new and poignant,
something that filled me with an indescribable
pity for the loneliness I now understood, and
for the courage of the nature that bore it so superbly.
She would ask nothing of the world, this woman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Nor would she defend herself. People could think
what they chose. But she would suffer.</p>

<p>I leaned toward her. "Mrs. Brandow," I said,
"I wish I could make you understand how I feel
about this. I believe it has made me ten years older."</p>

<p>She smiled. "That would be a pity," she said,
"when you're so deliciously young."</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do?" I persisted.</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows. "I'm afraid not," she
murmured, "unless it is to cease doing anything.
You see, your activities where I am concerned are
so hectic."</p>

<p>I felt my face burn. "You're very hard on me,
but I deserve it. I didn't realize," I repeated, "that
the story would suggest you to the public."</p>

<p>"Even though you described me?" she interjected,
the odd, sardonic gleam deepening in her
black eyes.</p>

<p>"But I didn't describe you as you are," I protested,
eagerly. "I made you a blonde! Don't
you remember? And I made a Western city the
scene of the trial, and changed some of the conditions
of the&mdash;" I faltered&mdash;"of the crime."</p>

<p>"As if that mattered," she said, coolly. "You
described <i>me</i>&mdash;to the shape of my finger-nails, the
buttons on my shoes." Suddenly she laughed.
"Those dreadful buttons! I see them still in my
dreams. It seems to me that I was always sewing
them on. The only parts of me I allowed to move
in the court-room were my feet. No one could see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
them, under my skirt. I used to loosen a button
almost every day. Then of course I had to sew them
on. I had a sick fear of looking messy and untidy&mdash;of
degenerating physically."</p>

<p>She faced the wide windows and the snow-filled
sky. In my own chair, facing the fire, I also directly
faced her.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Europe," she announced at last.
"I'm sailing to-morrow morning&mdash;to be gone 'for
good,' as the children say. That's why I came to-night."
For a moment she sat in silence, wholly,
restfully at her ease. Dimly I began to realize that
she was enjoying the intimacy of the moment, the
sense of human companionship, and again it came to
me how tragically lonely she must be. She had no
near friends, and in the minds of all others there
must always be the hideous interrogation-point that
stood between her and life. At best she had "the
benefit of the doubt." And I had helped to destroy
even the little that was left to her. I could have
fallen at her feet.</p>

<p>"I'm going away," she added, "to see if there is
any place for me in the life abroad. If there is I
want to find it. If I were the sort of woman who
went in for good works, my problem would be easier;
but you see I'm not."</p>

<p>I smiled. I could not see her as a worker in organized
charity, parceling out benefits tied with red
tape. It was no effort, however, to picture her doing
many human and beautiful kindnesses in her own way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>We talked of Europe. I had never been there.
She spoke of northern Africa, of rides over Morocco
hills, of a caravan journey from Tangier to Fez, of
Algerian nights, of camping in the desert, of palms
and ripe figs and of tropical gardens. It was fascinating
talk in the purple lights of my driftwood fire,
with a snow-storm beating at my windows. Suddenly
she checked herself.</p>

<p>"I think, after all," she said, lightly, "you're
rather good for me. You've done me good to-night.
You did me good the day you visited me at
Fairview. You were so young, so much in earnest,
so much in love with life, and you saw so much with
your big, solemn eyes. You gave me something
new to think about, and I needed it. So&mdash;don't
regret anything."</p>

<p>I felt the tears spring to my eyes.</p>

<p>She drew on her gloves and buttoned them slowly,
still smiling at me.</p>

<p>"I might never even have seen your story," she
went on, quietly, "if my maid had not brought it
to me. I don't read <i>The Woman's Friend</i>." There
was a hint of the old superciliousness in her tone
and about her upper lip as she spoke. "On the
whole, I don't think it did me any harm. The opinion
of strangers is the least important thing in my
little arctic circle. So, forget me. Good night&mdash;and
good-by."</p>

<p>I kept her hand in mine for a moment. "Good-by,"
I said. "Peace be with you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>She drew her veil down over her face, and moved
to the door. I followed and opened it for her. On
the threshold she stopped and hesitated, looking
straight at me; and in that instant I knew as surely
as I ever knew anything in my life that now at last
her guard was down&mdash;that from the fastness of her
soul something horrible had escaped and was leaping
toward me. She cast a quick glance up and
down the outer hall. It was dim and empty. I
hardly dared to breathe.</p>

<p>"There is one thing more," she said, and her
words rushed out with an odd effect of breathlessness
under the continued calm of her manner. "The
only really human emotion I've felt in a long time
is&mdash;an upheaval of curiosity."</p>

<p>I looked at her, and waited.</p>

<p>She hesitated an instant longer, then, standing
very close to me, gripped my shoulders hard, her
eyes deep in mine, her voice so low I hardly caught
her meaning.</p>

<p>"Oh, wise young judge!" she whispered. "Tell
me, before we part&mdash;<i>how did you know</i>?"</p>

<h2>VI<br />

<span class="s08">THE LAST OF THE MORANS</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
On my right rose a jagged wall of rock, hundreds
of feet high and bare of vegetation save for
a few dwarfed and wind-swept pines. On my left
gaped the wide mouth of what seemed to be a bottomless
ravine. Between the two was a ledge not
more than six feet wide, along which "Jef'son Davis,"
my mountain horse, was slowly and thoughtfully
making his difficult way. Occasionally from the
pit's depths a hawk or turkey-buzzard rose, startling
me with the flapping of its strong wings, and
several times the feet of Jef'son Davis dislodged a
bit of rock which rattled across the ledge, slipped
over the side, and started on a downward journey
whose distance I dared not estimate.</p>

<p>For more than an hour I had not met a human
being. I had not seen a mountain cabin or even
a nodding plume of smoke. I had not heard the
bark of a dog, the tinkle of a cow-bell, nor any other
reassuring and homely testimony that I was in a
world of men. Yet I knew that somewhere around
me must be lurking figures and watchful eyes, for
I was in the stronghold of the Morans and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Tyrrells, and the Morans and Tyrrells were on the
war-path, and therefore incessantly on guard.</p>

<p>This journey through the Virginia mountains to
"write up family feuds" was the result of an inspiration
recently experienced by Colonel Cartwell,
our editor-in-chief. He was sure I could uncover
"good dramatic stuff."</p>

<p>"They're potting at each other every minute
down there," he explained to me when he sent me
off on the assignment. "Give their time to it. Morans
and Tyrrells are the worst. Tyrrell has killed
six Morans. Get his story before the Morans get
him. See? And find out what it's all about, anyway."</p>

<p>According to the map I had made that morning
under the direction of the postmaster of Jayne's
Crossroads, I knew I must be even now within a
mile of the cabin of the Morans.</p>

<p>"'Tain't healthy travelin' fo' men," that gentleman
had volunteered languidly, "but I reckon a
lady's safe 'nuff, 'specially ef yo' leave the jou'ney
to the hawse. Jef'son Davis, he knows ev'ry inch
of that thar trail. All yo' got t' do is t' give Jef'son
his haid."</p>

<p>Jef'son Davis was having his head, and he had
thus far been true to his trust. At a certain point
on the trail I was to look for huge boulders in a
strange position, with a big and lonely cedar standing
guard near them. At the right of this cedar was
an almost hidden trail, which, followed for twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
minutes, would lead me to the Moran cabin. I was
not to be alarmed if a bullet whispered its sinister
message in my ear. To kill women was no part of
the Moran traditions, and a fatality to me would
be a regrettable incident, due wholly, if it occurred
at all, to the impulsive nature of Samuel Tyrrell,
who had formed the careless habit of firing at moving
objects without pausing to discover what they
were. It was because of this eccentricity, I gathered,
that the sympathy of the mountain people lay
largely with Moran&mdash;who, moreover, though both
men were the last of their respective lines, was a
boy of twenty-two, while Tyrrell was well on in
middle life.</p>

<p>I rode slowly along the trail, which, clear in the
high lights of the noonday sun, was now widening
and turning to the right. The ravine appeared to
be growing more shallow. Flashes of red haw and
scarlet dogwood began to leap out at me from the
edges. Presently, beyond the turn, I discovered
the boulders, silhouetted sharply against the soft
October sky. Near them was the lonely cedar, and
after twice passing it I found the side-trail, and rode
peacefully down its dim corridor.</p>

<p>There was nothing to mark the Moran home,
and that, too, I almost passed before I noticed it,
a strongly built log cabin, backed against the side
of a hill, and commanding from its three barred
windows the approaches on every side. As I rode
up, the door opened and an old woman in a homespun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
dress stood before me. Her shoulders sagged
under the burden of seventy-five years, but the
flame of an unconquerable spirit burned in the keen
black eyes set bead-like in her withered little brown
face. This, I knew, was Betsy Moran, who had
helped to bury her husband, four sons, and a grandson,
all killed by the Tyrrells, and who was said
finally to have seized a gun herself and added at
least one Tyrrell to the row in the family burial-lot.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" I asked, cheerfully. "May I
come in and rest for a few moments?"</p>

<p>Her face did not soften, nor did she speak, but
there was neither suspicion nor fear in her steady
regard; it held merely a dispassionate curiosity. I
slipped from the back of Jef'son Davis and hesitated,
looking around for a post or tree to tie him
to, and the old woman, stirred to a quick instinct
of hospitality, looked uncertainly behind her into
the cabin. At the same instant a young giant appeared
behind her, pushed her lightly to one side,
and strode toward me with a nod of greeting. Then,
taking the bridle-rein from my hand, and still in
silence, he led the horse away. Evidently the Morans
were not a talkative family.</p>

<p>Wholly forgetting the old woman, I stared after
him. Here, obviously, was young "Shep," the last
of the Morans; and from the top of his curly black
hair to the boot-soles six feet two inches below it,
he looked extremely well able to take care of himself.
He was powerfully built, and he moved with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the natural grace of the superb young animal he was.
He wore a rough homespun blue shirt, open at the
neck, and a pair of corduroy trousers tucked into
high boots. From the swing of his back as he strode
off with Jef'son Davis I should hardly have been surprised
to see him throw that weary animal across his
mighty shoulders.</p>

<p>When he had disappeared I walked thoughtfully
to the cabin door, meeting again the level gaze of
my hostess. A sudden gleam in her eyes and a quick
lift of her white head showed me she had caught
my unconscious tribute to the strength and beauty
of the young man, who was not only the last of her
line, but, according to mountain traditions, the
"apple of her eye."</p>

<p>"Come 'long in," she said, quietly; and she added
as I crossed her threshold, "Ef yo' rid 'crost th' Gap,
yo' mus' be mi-i-ghty ti'ed."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illo137" id="illo137"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">It Was Young "Shep," the Last of the Morans</span></p>
</div>

<p>She pushed a chair in front of the great fireplace
which filled one side of the cabin, and I dropped
gladly into it and took off my hat, while she bustled
about with hospitable enterprise, heating water and
rattling tea-cups. Suddenly she disappeared, and in
another instant I heard the despairing, final squawk
of an unfortunate hen. I knew that within the hour
it would be served to me in a strange dish in which
the flavors of burnt feathers and of tough, unseasoned
meat would struggle for recognition, and
I sighed. But the great logs burning in the old fireplace
were good to watch, and their warmth was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
comforting, for the sun had suddenly gone behind
a cloud and an autumn wind had begun to whine
around the cabin and in the big chimney.</p>

<p>There were only five pieces of furniture in the
room&mdash;a narrow, home-made wooden bed occupying
one corner, a large spinning-wheel, a pine table,
a rough log settle, and the chair in which I sat. At
the right of the fireplace a ladder led to a trap-door
which evidently opened into a low attic&mdash;young
Moran's quarters, I assumed. Just outside the open
door stood a low, flat-topped tree-trunk, holding a
tin basin full of water; a homespun towel on a nail
below it testified mutely to its past usefulness.
While I was regarding these, the master of the house
reappeared, plunged his black head into the basin,
flung the water in a spray over his face and hands,
wiped them on the towel, and entered the cabin,
ready for dinner. His immediate impulse was to
attend to the fire, and as he approached it he cast
a side glance at me, as shy and curious as that of
some half-tamed creature of the open. When he
had put on another log he spoke without looking
at me, his brown cheeks flushing with the effort.</p>

<p>"Done fed th' critter," he announced, laconically.</p>

<p>I thanked him, and mercifully kept my eyes on
the fire. For a time he remained there, too, with
occasional darting glances at me, which finally, as
I seemed unaware of them, settled into a steady
and close inspection. I realized what a strange,
new type I presented to him&mdash;a young woman from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
New York, wearing a riding-habit and riding-boots,
trim and slim and tailor-made. His glance lingered
a long time on my hair and my hands. There was
nothing offensive about it. At first merely curious,
it had finally become reflective and friendly. At
last I began to talk to him, and after several false
starts he was able to respond, sprawling opposite
me on the big settle, his hands clasped behind his
curly head, his legs extended toward the fire, while
I told him of New York and answered his extraordinary
questions.</p>

<p>It had seemed somehow fitting that the sun should
go behind a cloud when I entered this tragic home;
but for a long time there was no intimation in our
talk of the other shadows that lay over the cabin,
of the bloody trail that led to it, of the tragic row
of graves on the hill beside it, or of the bullets that
had whispered the failure of their mission in this
boy's ears. We were a fairly cheerful company as
we drew up to the pine table when the old woman
announced dinner, and even the stoic calm of her
face relaxed over the story of some of my experiences
on the trail with Jef'son Davis. She did the
honors of her house a little stiffly, but with dignity;
and always, except when she was thus engaged,
her black eyes focused on the face of her grandson
and clung there, fixed. Her contribution to our
talk consisted of two eloquent sentences:</p>

<p>"Sometimes we got but'r," she remarked, as we
sat down, "sometimes we hain't. T'day we hain't."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>We had, however, the expected chicken, with
corn bread and tea, and in the perfect flowering of
his hospitality, young Shep Moran heaped these
high upon my plate, and mourned when I refused
to devour the entire repast. He was chatting now
with much self-possession, while under his talk and
his occasional shy but brilliant smile his grandmother
expanded like a thirsty plant receiving water.
He had, he told me proudly, learned to read, and he
owned two books&mdash;the Bible and some poems by
a man named Whittier. He knew most of the poems
"by hea't." He had never ridden on a railroad-train,
but he could ride any animal that traveled
on four legs, and he had heard a fiddle played upon
during his one expedition out into the great world&mdash;his
solitary visit to Jayne's Crossroads, two years
before.</p>

<p>When dinner was over he smoked a clay pipe before
the fire, and gradually his talk grew more intimate.
He and his grandmother were going to leave
the cabin, he said, and live on the other side of the
mountain. A man had offered him a job in some
coal-mines that were being opened up. But he could
not go yet&mdash;there was something he had to do first.
The shadow over the cabin seemed to deepen as he
spoke. I knew what he had to do&mdash;he had to kill
Samuel Tyrrell, who had killed his father. His
uncles, his brother, and Samuel Tyrrell's sons had
killed one another. There were only himself and
Samuel Tyrrell left.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>He turned and looked at me. His whole expression
had changed&mdash;his brow was somber, his eyes brooding,
his lips drawn back from his teeth in an odd,
unconscious snarl. Quite naturally he took it for
granted that I knew of him and his feud.</p>

<p>"Sam Tyrrell, he'd&mdash;" he hesitated, then added
under his breath, as he glanced at the old woman
moving toward the cupboard with her dishes&mdash;"he'd
even shoot at gran ef he ketched 'er on the
trail."</p>

<p>I rose and put on my hat. Before my eyes my
mountain demigod had suddenly been transformed
into a young beast, lusting for blood. I felt that I
must get away from the oppression of the place. He
made no comment, but picked up his hat and went
for my horse. When he returned he was leading
Jef'son Davis and riding his own horse, a rough-coated
mountain animal which, powerful though it
was, seemed hardly up to the huge bulk astride it.
With a jerk of his head, he checked my protest and
the little cry that broke from his grandmother's lips.</p>

<p>"I'm jes' gwine ter th' bend," he told her, "t'
p'int aout th' trail t' Clapham's. She's gwine t' stay
all night thar. Look fo' me home 'fore sundown."</p>

<p>The grandmother cast a quick glance at me, then
dropped her eyes. The fire seemed to have flickered
and died out. Her steps dragged. In an instant
she had become a feeble, apprehensive old woman.</p>

<p>"Don't you take Shep no furder 'n th' bend," she
quavered. "Will yuh?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>I met her look squarely. "You may be sure I
will not," I promised, and we rode away.</p>

<p>Young Moran's horse proved better than he
looked. With the greatest ease and lightness he
carried his rider along the trail, a little in advance
of me where it was narrow, and close beside me when
it widened out. As we rode, the young man became
all boy again. He knew every mountain tree and
shrub, every late plant that had raised a brave head
above the pall of autumn leaves, every bird whose
note sounded near us or which winged its flight above
us. He pointed out the bright yellow blossoms of
the evening primrose, the bursting pods of the milkweed,
the "purty look" of asters, gentian, and white
everlasting against the somber background of the
hills. He was delighted when we flushed a covey
of quail, and at one point he stopped abruptly to
show me the old swimming-hole which he and his
brother had used, and on the banks of which, he
added grimly, his brother had been killed by Tyrrell's
eldest son. At this memory the shadow fell
upon him again, and it was while we were riding
on in a silence broken only by the padded hoof-beats
of the horses that we heard a shot. Something
from the underbrush at our right went humming
past me, clipped a leaf from an overhanging
bough above my companion's head, and sped onward
to its harmless finish. Moran's horse, jerked back
on its haunches by the rider's powerful grip on
the bridle, stopped, trembling. Jef'son Davis shied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
violently, only to be caught and steadied by the
instantaneous grasp of Moran's right hand. In the
same second the young man himself was transformed
from the simple, gentle nature-lover of the
trail to a half-human spirit of hatred and revenge.</p>

<p>"The polecat!" he hissed. "I know whar he is.
I'll <i>git</i> him this time!" With a quick swing he turned
his horse. "Thar's your trail," he called back over
his shoulder. "Straight on tuh th' bend&mdash;then go
left."</p>

<p>He put his horse at a low but sharp incline on the
right, and the animal scrambled up it with straining
muscles and tearing hoofs that sent back a
shower of stones and earth. In another moment
horse and rider were out of sight.</p>

<p>It had all happened so suddenly that I had felt
no fear. Now, left alone, it seemed incredible that
it should have happened at all. Outwardly, everything
was as it had been a moment before. The
soft haze of the October atmosphere still lay over
the silent hills; the reassuring whir of crickets was
in the air. Jef'son Davis, happy in the comfort of
a lax bridle, was eagerly cropping the leaves from
an overhanging tree-branch. Yet within pistol-shot
of this spot an assassin had crouched. Even now
he and his enemy were perhaps having their last
struggle.</p>

<p>With a deep breath, I gathered up the bridle and
rode back at full speed along the trail over which
I had come. When I drew near the Moran cabin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
I checked Jef'son Davis's pace and proceeded
at a gentle canter. I did not wish to alarm Betsy
Moran, but the door flew open while I was still
some distance away, and the old woman hurried
to meet me. Almost as soon as I had jumped from
the saddle she was beside me, her eyes staring into
mine with the question she dared not ask.</p>

<p>"Nothing serious has happened," I said, quickly,
"but&mdash;" As I hesitated, she finished the sentence.</p>

<p>"They're arfter each othe'?" she said, dully.
"They're shootin'?"</p>

<p>I nodded. Without another word, she turned and
entered the cabin. I tethered my horse to a tree and
followed her. There was nothing of helpless age
about her now. Instead there was something horrible
in her silence, something appalling in the preparations
she at once began to make. She had gone
through it all before&mdash;many, many times. She was
ready to go through it again whenever the hour
struck, and she had developed a terrible efficiency.</p>

<p>She filled the great kettle with water. She turned
down the covers of the bed. From a closet in the
wall she brought out linen and bandages, a few
bottles, and several bundles of herbs, of which she
began to make some sort of brew. At last she came
and sat by the fire, crouched over it, waiting and
listening. Occasionally she rose, went to the door,
and looked out. Once or twice she whimpered a
little, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>Darkness came. Several times I rose and put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
fresh logs on the fire. I found and lit a candle, to
help out the firelight. It had become impossible
to sit longer in that dim room, with its shadows and
its memories, watching the terrible patience of the
mountain woman and picturing a dead man, or a
wounded one, lying helpless near the trail.</p>

<p>"Can't I ride somewhere and get some one?" I
suggested once.</p>

<p>"No," the old woman answered, curtly. Half
an hour later she added, more gently, and as if
there had been no interval between her words:
"They ain't no doctor in thirty miles. Ef Shep gits
home, I kin tend t' him."</p>

<p>It was after ten o'clock before we heard a sound
outside. I jumped to my feet, but the old woman
was before me. Hurrying to the door, she flung it
wide, and, shielding the candle with her hand,
peered out into the blackness. Then, with a little
cry, she handed the candle to me and ran forward.
In the darkness something was crawling toward us,
something that stumbled and rose and stumbled
again. It collapsed just as it reached us, and fell
near the threshold.</p>

<p>Someway, together, we dragged the last of the
Morans into his home, and closed the door between
him and his mountain world. His great body seemed
to fill the cabin as it lay upon the floor, the arms
and legs sprawling in incredible helplessness, the
boots and trousers covered with mud, the blue shirt
torn and blood-stained. Seizing one of her bottles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the old woman forced some of its contents between
the boy's teeth, and as she did so he opened his eyes.
For a moment he stared at her, at me, and around
the cabin, dim in the flickering light of logs and
candle. Then a gleam lit up his black eyes. His
lips drew back over his teeth in a hideous, wolflike
grin.</p>

<p>"He's done daid, gran," he choked out. "I got
'im!"</p>

<p>The old woman, who had been bending above him,
dropped the bottle and sat back suddenly, flinging
her lean arms above her head in a movement of wild
exultation. A high cackle of joy broke from her.
Then, remembering his need, she bent over him
again and tried to force him to take more of the
liquor; but he frowned it away, his stiff tongue
seeking to form words.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;watched&mdash;him&mdash;die," he finally articulated,
"'fo'&mdash;ever&mdash;I&mdash;tho't&mdash;o'&mdash;home!"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and lapsed into unconsciousness.
The old woman rocked above him.</p>

<p>"He's daid," she crooned. "He's daid, daid,
daid!"</p>

<p>For a moment I thought it was her grandson she
meant, but I saw that she was continuing her ministrations,
accompanying them with this reassurance
to those deaf ears. For a long time the hideous
lullaby went on, while she washed the wound in the
boy's breast and checked its flow of blood, bandaging
it as skilfully as any surgeon could have done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the work. She let me help her now&mdash;keeping cold
compresses on his hot head, for he was moaning with
pain and fever, and giving him from time to time
the medicine she had brewed. We could not move
his great body, but we made him as comfortable
as we could on the floor, and worked over him there
while the night wore on, and the cries of prowling
animals came to us from the mountainside.</p>

<p>Toward dawn the fever subsided. The boy's high
color faded, and he hardly seemed to breathe. In
my inexperience I was not sure whether these were
good or bad signs, and I had no indication from Betsy
Moran, whose face never changed as she hung above
him. At sunrise she rose and went to the door,
motioning to me to accompany her. There, following
the direction indicated by her pointing, shaking
old finger, I saw on the side of the hill, at the left
of the cabin, six low mounds marked by six great
boulders. For a long time the mountain woman
looked at them in silence. Then she turned to me.</p>

<p>"He's daid," she whispered, with a kind of fierce
delight. "<i>Tyrrell's daid.</i> Here's the e-end."</p>

<p>She leaned against the jamb of the door, staring
up at the row of mounds defined against the desolate
mountain by the first clear rays of the sun. A
light breeze lifted the loose locks of her white hair
and blew them about her face. In her eyes shone the
wild exultation that had burned there the night before,
when her boy had gasped out his message.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Moran," I asked, quietly, "how many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Tyrrell graves are there?" She answered me somberly,
almost absently. "Five," she said. Then,
on a sudden memory, her shriveled arm went up
in a gesture of triumph. "<i>Six!</i>" she corrected herself,
exultantly. "Be six in th' Tyrrell lot t'-morrer."</p>

<p>Six in the Tyrrell lot to-morrow. Six in the
Moran lot to-day&mdash;perhaps seven there to-morrow.
And why? Unconsciously I uttered the word aloud,
and the hills seemed to fling back the ironic question.
Beside me the old woman stirred, thinking I was
speaking to her. As if the words had touched a hidden
spring, her confidence gushed forth, and as she
talked she lifted her hands and began to twist into
the tiny knob of hair at the back of her head the
white locks that blew about her eyes.</p>

<p>"'Twas fo'ty yeahs back," she said, at last, almost
to herself. "Come Christmas, hit's fo'ty yeahs back.
Er yearlin' o' ourn had tooken up with neighbor
cattle, an' Tyrrell, he done claimed hit. They was
always polecats, th' Tyrrells. Words come o' that,
an' licks follered clost. At las' Tyrrell, he shot Amos&mdash;my
man. 'Twa'n't long fo' Jep, my oldest, Shep's
father, he killed Tyrrell. That's th' sta't of it. Now
we've come t' th' e-end," she finished, and drew a
long breath. "He's daid&mdash;Tyrrell's daid. Shep,
he seen 'um die."</p>

<p>She led the way back into the cabin, and stopped
at the foot of the ladder. "Go up thar," she said,
almost gently. "Git some sleep. I reckon ye're perished
fo' it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>I protested, but in vain. It finally became plain
that for some reason she wished to be rid of me. She
brought me a cup of some dark liquid and urged me
to drink it. It was not tempting in appearance or
flavor, but I drank it down. Then, as she still waited,
I ascended the ladder and found myself in Shep's
room&mdash;a tiny attic, its rafters hung with drying
herbs, its pallet on the floor surprisingly clean, its
one narrow window covering the Tyrrell trail. I had
not expected to sleep, but I did&mdash;slept while the day
mounted to high noon and waned to a gorgeous
autumnal sunset.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the sound of hoof-beats, of
men's voices, of many steps on the floor of the room
below. For an instant I lay in puzzled silence, staring
at the rafters above my head. Then, as memory
awakened in its turn, I rose hurriedly and began to
dress, my fingers shaking with excitement and nervousness.
I understood the meaning of those pawing
hoofs, of those heavy steps and rough voices, and as
I dressed I listened. But all I caught was the tramp
of feet, the scrape of furniture dragged across the
floor, the whinnying of horses, impatient in the rising
evening wind. Once I heard the old woman's
voice, but I could distinguish only the word "sheriff."
Soon I heard the heavy steps pass out of the
house, and the creak and rattle of saddles and
bridles as the visitors mounted their horses and rode
away. They went slowly. They had arranged,
I assumed, some sort of litter for the wounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
man. In the room below there was absolutely no
sound.</p>

<p>For a moment I hesitated. How could I go down
and face that stricken old creature to whom life had
just given this final turn of its relentless screw?
Then, very slowly, I descended the ladder, my back
to the room, afraid to move my eyes for fear of
the scene they might rest upon. It was not until
I stood on the cabin floor that I dared to look
around me.</p>

<p>The living-room was swept and in perfect order.
The last reflection of the setting sun lay in a brilliant
line across its immaculate floor. The door was open,
affording a view of the long trail, along which the
horsemen could be seen, riding slowly in single file.
The kettle hung on the crane, the table was set for
supper, and in the center of this peaceful scene my
hostess sat alone, knitting a blue yarn sock.</p>

<p>Slowly she looked up at me. "Ef yo' slep' well,"
she said, quietly, "mou't be yer ready t' eat?"</p>

<p>She rose, laid down the blue sock, and began to
move about the room. Speechless, I stared at her.
I had thought the night before that, coming from
her, no evidence of self-control could surprise me.
But this uncanny poise filled me with a sort of awe.
I dared not even ask a question. She had erected
between us the barrier of her primitive dignity, her
terrible courage. I could no more pass it than I
could have broken through the thick walls of her
cabin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>She placed the chair at the table, and in silence
I sat down. She poured tea for me, and cut a wedge
of corn bread, but I could not eat. After a few
moments I gave up the effort, rose, and took my
hat from the nail on which it hung. She watched
me as I drew on my gloves. The action seemed to
recall something to her.</p>

<p>"Shep," she said, casually, "he had t' borry yo'
critter. Ye'll git it back soon's he kin send it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed, startled. "But&mdash;but was he
able to ride&mdash;with his wound?"</p>

<p>She looked at me, her eyes showing the scorn of
the primitive woman for such softness. "Lordy!
Hawseback's same's a cradle to Shep," she muttered.</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"They rode very slowly," I said. "I hope it won't
hurt him. Good-by," and I held out my hand. "I'll
walk to Clapham's. I know the way."</p>

<p>She put her hand in mine. In her eyes danced a
sudden light, half mocking, half ecstatic. "Shep,
he got off 'bout sun-up," she drawled. "Fo'ty mile
along he wuz 'fo' ever sheriff come a-nigh this
place!"</p>

<p>I could not speak, but something, I know, flashed
in my face and was reflected in hers. For a moment
longer her wrinkled old hand lay still in mine. She
seemed loath to withdraw it, anxious to say more.
Perhaps she was recalling the long vigil of the night,
when we two had worked together over the unconscious
form of the last of the Morans. But her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
vocabulary offered her nothing with which to clothe
those naked hours.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she repeated. And she ended primly:
"I wish yo' well, miss. I sho'ly hev inj'yed yo'
comp'ny!"</p>

<h2>VII<br />

<span class="s08">TO THE RESCUE OF MISS MORRIS</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
I met Grace Morris for the first time at Mrs.
Hatfield's musical tea&mdash;a unique affair at which
the half-dozen world-famous artists our hostess had
engaged for the afternoon strove vainly to make
their music heard above the care-free voices of her
guests. I had isolated myself behind a potted palm
in the great music-room, and was trying to distinguish
the strains of Mischa Elman's playing from
the conversational high notes around me when a
deprecating little laugh sounded in my ear.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said a clear, languid young voice.
"We might as well chat, too. But first <i>do</i> rise on
your toes, look over the purple plume on the fat
woman's hat, and catch one glimpse of Elman's expression!
He thinks we're all insane, or that he is."</p>

<p>I did not follow this stimulating suggestion. Instead
I looked at the speaker. She was a typical
New York society girl of twenty-three, or possibly
twenty-four, dressed to perfection and bored to extinction,
her pale, pretty features stamped with the
avid expression of the chronic seeker of new sensations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>"You're Miss Iverson, aren't you?" she went on,
when I had smiled my acknowledgment of her swift
service across the conversational net. "My brother
pointed you out to me at the theater the other night.
He wants us to meet. He's one of your editors on
the <i>Searchlight</i>, you know&mdash;Godfrey Morris."</p>

<p>In another minute we were chatting with as little
compunction as the ruthless throng around us, and
while we talked I studied Miss Morris. I knew a
great deal about her. She had only recently returned
from Germany, where for two years she had
been studying singing with Lehmann. She had an
exquisite voice, and, though it was understood that
she would make no professional use of it, she had
already sung at several concerts given in behalf of
charities that appealed to her. She possessed a large
fortune, inherited from her grandfather; her brother
Godfrey had inherited one of equally impressive
proportions, but its coming had not interrupted the
daily and nightly grind of his editorial work. Evidently
the Morrises, despite their languid air, sprang
from energetic stock. It was whispered that Miss
Morris's energies occasionally lent themselves to all-night
tango parties, and late suppers with Bohemian
friends in operatic and dramatic worlds whose orbits
hardly touched the exclusive one in which she dwelt;
but thus far there had been nothing more significant
than a few raised eyebrows to emphasize this gossip.</p>

<p>"I'm lucky to meet you," she ran on now. "It
saves writing a note. Mother and I want you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
dine with us Thursday evening of next week, at our
hotel. We haven't gone to housekeeping. We're
at the Berkeley for the winter, because Godfrey has
an apartment there. Can you come?&mdash;I'm so glad.
At eight, then."</p>

<p>A ravishing strain of music reached us. Simultaneously
the voice of the fat woman with the
purple plume uttered the final notes of the recital
she had been pouring into the ears of the acquaintance
on her left. "Then, and not till then," she
shouted, "I found that the unhappy woman <i>lived
on the West Side</i>!"</p>

<p>Miss Morris's eyes and mine exchanged a look
that carried us a long way forward on the road of
friendship.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't miss these musicales for the world,"
she murmured. "Isn't Mrs. Hatfield unique? Look
at her now, out in the dining-room, putting a layer
of French pastry over Amato's perfectly good voice!
He won't be able to sing for a week. Oh, Elman
has finished. Do you know him? No? Then come
and meet him."</p>

<p>Miss Morris interested me, and I was sorry to
say good-by to her when we parted, and genuinely
disappointed when I reached the Berkeley the following
Thursday night, to learn that she was not
to be with us at dinner. Her mother lost no time
in acquainting me with this distressing fact.</p>

<p>"Grace wants me to apologize for her, and to tell
you how <i>very</i> sorry she is to miss you," Mrs. Morris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
drawled at once, as she came forward to receive
me.</p>

<p>She was a charming woman of fifty, with white
hair, a young face, and the figure of a girl of twenty.
Under the controlled calm of her manner a deep-seated
nervousness struggled for expression. She
had her daughter's languor, but none of her cool
insolence or cynicism; in the look of her gray eyes
I caught a glint oddly like that in the eyes of her son.</p>

<p>"Grace was looking forward to your coming,"
she went on, as she seated herself on a davenport
facing the open fire, and motioned me to a place
beside her. "But an hour ago she received a note
from a friend who is in town only for the night.
There was something very urgent in it, and Grace
rushed off without stopping to explain. My son
Godfrey will be with us&mdash;and we hope Grace will
be back before you leave."</p>

<p>As if in response to his cue, "my son Godfrey"
appeared, looking extremely handsome in his evening
clothes, and rather absurdly pleased to find his
mother and me so deep in talk that we did not hear
him approach.</p>

<p>"Friends already, aren't you?" was his comment
on the effective tableau we made, and as we descended
in the elevator to the hotel dining-room
he explained again how glad he was to have his
mother and sister home after two years of absence,
and to bring us together at last.</p>

<p>The little dinner moved on charmingly, but before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
an hour had passed I realized that my host and
hostess were under some special strain. Mrs. Morris
wore a nervous, expectant look&mdash;the look of one
who is listening for a bell, or a step long overdue.
Several times I saw Godfrey glance toward the door,
and once I caught a swift look that passed between
him and his mother&mdash;a look charged with anxiety.
Both obviously tried to throw off their care, whatever
it was, and to a degree they succeeded. I was
sending my spoon into the deep heart of a raspberry-ice
when a servant leaned over the back of my chair
and confidentially addressed me.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, miss," he murmured, deprecatingly.
"But if it's Miss Iverson, a person wants Miss Iverson
on the wire."</p>

<p>I flushed and hesitated, glancing at Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>"Party says it's urgent, miss," prompted the servant.</p>

<p>I apologized to my hostess, and rose. There
seemed no other course open to me. Mrs. Morris
looked mildly amused; her son looked thoughtful
as he, too, rose and accompanied me across the
dining-room to the door, returning then to the table,
as I insisted that he must. In the telephone-booth
the voice of Grace Morris came to me over the wire,
not languid now, but quick and imperative.</p>

<p>"Miss Iverson?" she called. "Is that you at last?
Thank Heaven! I thought you were never coming.
Are mother and Godfrey still in the dining-room?
Good! Will you do me a favor? It's a big one&mdash;vital."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>I expressed my willingness to do Miss Morris a
vital favor.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "Then please do exactly
what I tell you. Go to the hotel desk and ask
the clerk for the key to my suite. I left it with him.
Then go up to my bedroom. On my dressing-table
you'll find an open letter I dropped there&mdash;or perhaps
it's on the floor. Conceal it in your bosom,
the way they do in books, and keep it for me till
we meet."</p>

<p>I gasped. With a rush, my mind leaped at some
of the possible results of carrying out this startling
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Morris," I protested, "I can't do
that. Suppose some one caught me in the act? It's
likely to happen. We're at dessert, and I heard
your mother order the coffee brought up to her sitting-room.
Isn't the letter safe till you get home?"</p>

<p>There was a sharp exclamation at the other end
of the line. Then Miss Morris's voice came to me
again, in the controlled accents of desperation.</p>

<p>"Miss Iverson," she urged, "you've simply got
to help me out! If my mother goes into my room
and sees that letter, she'll read it. She'll think it's
her duty. If she reads it&mdash;well, in plain words, there
will be the devil to pay. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>"But why not come home and get it yourself?"
I persisted.</p>

<p>"I can't. There isn't time. I'm away down at
the Lafayette. Heavens! I didn't mean to let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
that slip out, I'm so nervous I don't know what
I'm saying. Don't tell a soul where I am. Don't
even let any one know I've talked to you. And you
<i>must</i> get that letter. There isn't a minute to lose!"</p>

<p>It began to look as if I had to get that letter.
And since the thing must be done, I wanted it over.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, between my teeth, and hung
up the receiver, shutting off the stream of thanks
that gushed forth from the other end of the wire.
In the same mood of grim acceptance I went to
the hotel desk. I did not intend to make this part
of my task more difficult than it need be, so I paid
the clerk the compliment of truth.</p>

<p>"I want to get something from Miss Morris's
room," I told him, casually. "Will you give me the
key, please? I am dining with Mrs. Morris to-night."</p>

<p>He gave me a swift glance, then took the key
from its rack and handed it to me with a little bow.
In another moment I was in the elevator and on
my way to the tenth floor, on which, as I had learned,
each independent member of the Morris family occupied
a separate apartment, though the suites of
Mrs. Morris and her daughter had a connecting door.
The tag on Miss Morris's key gave me the number
of her suite, and I found her door without difficulty.
My fingers shook with nervousness as I inserted the
key in the lock. I felt like a housebreaker, and probably
looked like one, as I glanced anxiously over
my shoulder and up and down the long hall, which,
fortunately, was empty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>Once inside the apartment I regained my courage.
I went swiftly through the entrance-hall and the
sitting-room, turning, by instinct as it seemed, to
the door that opened into the bedroom. This, like
the sitting-room, was dark, and I could not immediately
find the switch that turned on the electric
light. There was, however, an open fire burning
behind a brass fender, and by its uncertain light I
made my way to the dressing-table, my eyes racing
ahead in their eager search. There, among a litter
of silver and glass toilet articles, powder-puffs, and
shell-pins, was the letter I was after&mdash;an unfolded
sheet, lying face downward. An envelope, obviously
that from which it had been taken, had fallen to
the floor.</p>

<p>I picked up the letter. Just as I did so the door
at the other end of the bedroom opened, and Mrs.
Morris entered. For an instant, startled, we faced
each other in the gloom. The next second, acting
on an impulse which seemed to flex the muscles of
my arm before it touched my brain, I flung the letter
into the fire. At the same moment Mrs. Morris
touched an electric switch beside the door and filled
the room with light. Then she came toward me,
easily and naturally.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are," she said. "The elevator-boy
told me you had come this way. Is anything
wrong? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>Her manner was perfect. There was exactly the
right degree of solicitude in her voice, of quiet assurance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
that everything would be at once and satisfactorily
explained. But as she spoke she turned
and fixed her eyes on the blazing letter in the fire.
All but one corner was burned, but the thick paper
kept its perfect outline. Bending, she picked up
the envelope from the floor, glanced at the address,
and nodded as if to herself, still holding it in her
hand.</p>

<p>For a second I remained speechless. It was a
hideous situation to be in. Still, even confronted by
Godfrey Morris's mother, I felt that I had done right,
and before the pause was too deeply underlined I
managed to reply naturally that nothing was wrong
and that I was quite well. When my hostess realized
that I did not intend to make any explanation,
she threw her arm across my shoulder and led me
from the room. It was not until we were again in
her sitting-room, and side by side on her big davenport,
that she spoke.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, then, very quietly, "won't
you trust me?"</p>

<p>I looked at her, and she smiled back at me, but
with something in her face that hurt. She seemed
suddenly to have grown old and care-worn.</p>

<p>"Do you imagine I don't understand?" she went
on. "I have not lived with my daughter Grace for
almost a quarter of a century without knowing her
rather well. Of course it was she who telephoned
you. Of course she asked you to find and burn that
letter. What else did she say? Where is she now?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
There is a vital reason why her brother and I should
know. We have been anxious about her all evening.
I am afraid you noticed it."</p>

<p>I admitted that I had. "I'm sorry," I added.
"But I can't explain. I really can't say anything.
I wish I could. I'm sure you will understand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris studied me in silence for a moment.
The glint in her gray eyes deepened. Her jaw-line
took on a sudden firmness, oddly like that of her son.</p>

<p>"Of course I understand," she said. "It's girlish
loyalty. You think you must stand by Grace&mdash;that
you must respect her confidence. But can't
you believe that Grace's mother and brother may
be wiser than she is?"</p>

<p>This, to one only two years emancipated from
family rule, had a familiar sound. Instinctively I
resented it.</p>

<p>"Aren't you forgetting," I asked, gently, "that
Miss Morris is really a woman of the world? It
isn't as if she were merely a school-girl, you know,
with immature judgment."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris sighed. "You don't understand,"
she murmured. "You may feel differently when
you talk to my son. I see that we must be very
frank with you."</p>

<p>With an effort she talked of other things for a few
moments, until Godfrey joined us. His face brightened
as he entered, and darkened when his mother
told him briefly what had occurred. Without preface,
he went at the heart of the tangle, in as direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
and professional a manner as if he were giving me
an assignment in the <i>Searchlight</i> office.</p>

<p>"It all means just this, Miss Iverson," he said.
"Grace has fallen in love with an utterly worthless
fellow. He has no family, no position; but those
things don't matter so much. Perhaps she has, as
she says, enough of them for two. What does matter
is that he comes of bad stock&mdash;rotten stock&mdash;that
he's a bounder and worse."</p>

<p>That surprised me, and I showed it.</p>

<p>"Oh, he has some qualities, I admit," added Morris.
"The most important one is a fine tenor voice.
He is a professional singer. That interested Grace
in the beginning. Now she is obsessed by him. She
has lost her head. Evidently he's in town to-night&mdash;you
heard my mother say that envelope was addressed
in his handwriting. They're together somewhere,
and Heaven only knows what they're hatching
up."</p>

<p>I resented that at first. Then it disturbed me.
Perhaps they <i>were</i> hatching up something.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to bore you with all this," Mr. Morris
apologized, "but Grace seems to have dragged you
into it. She and Dillon&mdash;that's the fellow's name&mdash;have
been trying to bring us 'round to their marriage.
Lately they've about given up hope of that.
Now I believe Grace is capable of eloping with him.
Of course, as you say, we can't control her, but I've
been looking up his record, and it's mighty bad. If
I could show her proofs of what I know is true, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
would throw him over. With a little more time I
can get them. I expect them this week. But if in
the mean time&mdash;to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, stood up, and began to
stride about the room.</p>

<p>I rose. "I haven't any idea what she intends to
do," I told him, truthfully. "And I can't tell you
where she is. But I'll do what I can. I'll try to
find her, and tell her what you say." I turned to
his mother. "Good night," I said. "I'll go at once."</p>

<p>They looked at each other, then at me. There
was something fine in the way their heads went up,
in the quiet dignity with which they both bade me
good-by. It was plain that they were hurt, that
they had little hope that I could do anything; but
they would not continue to humiliate themselves
by confidences or appeals to one who stood outside
the circle of anxiety which fate had drawn around
them.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Lafayette, I went patiently from
room to room of the big French restaurant, glancing
in at each door for the couple I sought. It was not
long before I found them. They were in a corner
in one of the smallest of the side rooms&mdash;one which
held only four or five tables. Grace Morris's back
was toward me as I entered the room, but her escort
faced me, and I had a moment in which to look him
over. He was a thin, reedy person, about thirty
years old, in immaculate evening dress, with a lock
of dry hair falling over a pale and narrow brow, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
with hollow, hectic eyes that burned into those of
his companion as he leaned over the table, facing
her. They were talking in very low tones, and so
earnestly that neither noticed me until I drew out
a third chair at the table and quietly dropped into
it. Both started violently. The man stared; Miss
Morris caught my arm.</p>

<p>"What happened?" she asked, quickly. "Mother
didn't get that letter?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "No one saw it. It's burned."</p>

<p>She relaxed in her chair, with a laugh of relief.</p>

<p>"Speaking of angels," she quoted. "I was telling
Herbert about you only a few moments ago." Her
manner changed. "Miss Iverson," she said, more
formally, "may I present Mr. Dillon?"</p>

<p>The reedy gentleman rose and bowed. She allowed
him the barest interval for this ceremony before she
continued.</p>

<p>"Herbert, listen to me," she said, emphatically.
"If Miss Iverson will stand by us, I'll do it."</p>

<p>The young man's sallow face lit up. He had nice
teeth and a pleasant smile. He had, also, the additional
charm of a really beautiful speaking-voice.
Already I began to understand why Miss Morris
liked him.</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's great!" he cried. "Miss Iverson,
Heaven has sent you. You've accomplished in ten
seconds what I've failed to do in three hours." He
turned to Miss Morris. "You explain," he said,
"while I pay the bill and get the car ready. I'm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
not going to give you a chance to change your
mind!"</p>

<p>He disappeared, and Miss Morris remarked, casually:
"We're going to be married to-night, with
you as maid of honor. Herbert gave me all the plans
in his letter, and I came down fully determined to
carry them out; but I've been hanging back. It's
frightfully dismal to trot off and be married all by
one's self&mdash;"</p>

<p>I stopped her, and hurriedly described what had
occurred at the Berkeley. She listened thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"The poor dears," she murmured. "They can't
get over the notion that I'm still in leading-strings.
They'll feel better after it's all over, whereas if mother
knew it was really coming off to-night she'd have a
succession of heart attacks between now and morning,
and Godfrey would spend the night pursuing
us. We're going to Jersey for the ceremony&mdash;to
a little country minister I've known since I was a
child. Herbert will drive the car, and we'll put you
into the chauffeur's fur coat."</p>

<p>It took me a long time to convince her that I
would not play the important rôle she had assigned
to me on the evening's program. At last, however,
she seemed impressed by my seriousness, and by the
emphasis I laid on the repetition of her brother's
words. She rose, resumed her usual languidly insolent
air, and led the way from the room. In the
main hall, near the door, we found Mr. Dillon struggling
into a heavy coat while he gave orders to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
stout youth who seemed to be his chauffeur. Miss
Morris drew Dillon to one side, and for a few moments
the two talked together. Then they came toward
me, smiling.</p>

<p>"All right," said the prospective bridegroom,
with much cheerfulness. "Since she insists, we'll
take Miss Iverson home first."</p>

<p>He gave me a cap that lay in the tonneau, helped
Miss Morris and me into fur coats, settled us comfortably
in the back seat, folded heavy rugs over
our knees with great care, sprang into the driver's
place, and took the wheel. In another moment the
car leaped forward, turned a corner at an appallingly
sharp angle, and went racing along a dark side-street
at a speed that made the lamp-posts slip by us like
wraiths. The wind sang past our ears. Miss Morris
put her lips close to my face and laughed exultantly.</p>

<p>"You're going, after all, you see," she triumphed.
"Herbert and I aren't easy to stop when we've set
our hearts on anything. Here&mdash;what are you doing?
Don't be an idiot!"</p>

<p>She caught me as I tried to throw off the rugs. I
had some mad idea of jumping out, of stopping the
car, even if I paid for it by serious injury; but her
strong grip held me fast.</p>

<p>"I thought you had more sense," she panted.
"There, that's right. Sit still."</p>

<p>I sat still, trying to think. This mad escapade
would not only cost me my position on the <i>Searchlight</i>,
where Godfrey Morris was growing daily in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
power, but, what was infinitely worse, it would cost
me his interest and friendship. More than any one
else, in my two years on the newspaper, he had been
helpful, sympathetic, and understanding. And this
was my return to him. What would he think of me?
What must I think of myself?</p>

<p>We were across the ferry now. Dillon stopped the
car and got out to light the lamps. During the
interval Miss Morris held me by a seemingly affectionate,
but uncomfortably tight, pressure of an arm
through mine. I made no effort to get away. Whatever
happened, I had now decided I must see the
thing through. There was always a chance that
in some way, <i>any</i> way, I could prevent the marriage.</p>

<p>The great car sped on again, through a fog that,
thin at first, finally pressed against us like a moist
gray net. Though we could see hardly a dozen yards
ahead of us, Dillon did not slacken his alarming
speed. From time to time we knew, by the wan
glimmer of street lamps through the mist, that we
were sweeping through some town. Gradually the
roads grew rougher. Occasionally we made sharp
turns, Dillon stopping often to consult with Miss
Morris, who at first had seemed to know the way,
but who now made suggestions with growing uncertainty.
Plainly, we had left the highway and were
on country roads. The fog lifted a trifle, and rain
began to fall&mdash;lightly at first, then in a cold, steady
downpour. The car jolted over the ruts in the road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
tipped at a dangerous angle once or twice, but struggled
on.</p>

<p>In varying degrees our tempers began to feel the
effect of the cold, the roughness, and the long-continued
strain. Miss Morris and I sat silent. At
his wheel Dillon had begun to swear, at first under
his breath, then more audibly, in irritable, muttered
words, and finally openly and fluently, when he realized
that we had lost our way. Suddenly he stopped
the car with a jerk that almost threw us out of our
seats.</p>

<p>"What dashed place is this?" he demanded, turning
for the first time to face us. "Thought you
knew the way, Grace?"</p>

<p>With an obvious effort to ignore his manner, Miss
Morris peered unhappily into the gray mist around
us. "I don't recognize it at all," she confessed, at
last. "We must have taken the wrong turn somewhere.
I'm afraid we're lost."</p>

<p>Our escort swore again. His self-control, sufficient
when all was going smoothly, had quite deserted
him. I stared at him, trying to realize that this was
the charming young man I had met at the Lafayette
less than three hours ago.</p>

<p>"This is an infernal mess," he exclaimed at last.
"We're in some sort of marsh! The mud's a foot
deep!"</p>

<p>He continued to pull and tug and twist and swear,
while the car responded with eager throbs of its willing
heart, but with lagging wheels. At last, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
we were through the worst of the marsh and out into
a wider roadway, and just as we began to go more
smoothly there was a sudden, loud report. The car
swerved. A series of oaths poured from Dillon's
lips as he stopped the car and got out in the mud to
inspect the damage.</p>

<p>"Cast a shoe, dash her," he snarled. "And on a
road a million miles from any place. Of all the fool
performances this trip was the worst. Why didn't
you watch where you were going, Grace? You said
you knew the way. You knew I didn't know it."</p>

<p>His last words had degenerated into an actual
whine. Looking at him, as he stood in the mud,
staring vacantly at us, I had a feeling that, absurd
and impossible as it seemed, in another minute the
young man would burst into tears! His nerves
were in tatters; all self-control, all self-respect, was
gone.</p>

<p>Miss Morris did not answer. She merely sat still
and looked at him, at first in a white, flaming anger
that was the more impressive because so quiet, later
in an odd, puzzled fashion, as if some solution of
the problem he presented had begun to dawn upon
her. He meantime took off his fur coat and evening
coat, rolled up his sleeves, and got ready for
his uncongenial task of putting on a new tire. I
took the big electric bull's-eye he handed me, and
directed its light upon his work. By the time the
new tire was on, his light evening shoes were unrecognizable,
his clothes were covered with mud,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
his face was flushed with exertion and anger, and the
few words he spoke came out with a whine of exhausted
vitality. At last he stopped work, straightened
up, reached into the car, and fumbled in the
pocket of his overcoat. Then he walked around to
the side of the car farthest from us, and bent forward
as if to inspect something there. I started to
follow him, but he checked me.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," he said, curtly. "Don't
need you."</p>

<p>A moment later he came back to us, opened the
door, and motioned us into the tonneau. In the
short interval his whole manner had changed. He
had stopped muttering and swearing; he seemed
anxious to make us comfortable, and he folded the
rugs over our knees with special care, casting at
Miss Morris a series of anxious glances, which she
quietly ignored. Before he got in and took his place
at the wheel he made a careful inspection of the
other tires, and several times, as I changed the position
of the light to fall more directly upon them, he
smiled and thanked me. Miss Morris was evidently
impressed by his change of mood. Quietly and seriously
she studied him.</p>

<p>He was directly beside me now, bending over the
rear right tire, and suddenly, as his bare arm came
into view, I saw on it something that made me start
and look at it again. I had not been mistaken. I
glanced at Miss Morris. Her eyes were on Dillon,
but in her place on the left side of the car she commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
a view of only his head and shoulders. As
if annoyed by a flicker in the light, I lifted the bull's-eye
into my lap and began to fumble with the snap,
turning off the light. The little man&oelig;uver had the
effect I expected. Mr. Dillon stood up at once,
and his bare arm came helpfully forward.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, trying to take
the bull's-eye. "Let me see."</p>

<p>I held it tight. At the same instant I flashed
the light on again.</p>

<p>"<i>This</i> is the matter," I said. "There's no mistaking
what it means!"</p>

<p>To my ears my voice sounded hysterical, and I
have no doubt it was, for what I was doing went
against the grain. The one thing I most desire is to
play the great game of life according to the highest
rules. Yet here, under the eyes of Dillon's future
wife, I was directing a relentless light on the young
man's bare arm&mdash;an arm peppered with dark needle-pricks,
and covered with telltale scars. For one instant,
before the mind of its owner took in what I
was saying, it remained before us, giving its mute,
horrible testimony to constant use of the hypodermatic
syringe. The next, it was wrenched away
with a jerk that knocked the bull's-eye from my hand.
Over me Dillon leaned, his face livid with rage.</p>

<p>"I'll make you regret that!" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Oh no, you won't, Herbert," Miss Morris said,
gently. "This is not a melodrama, you know. And
you haven't anything against Miss Iverson, for I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
was already beginning to&mdash;to&mdash;understand. Take
us home."</p>

<p>He started to speak, but something in her eyes
checked him, and with a little shrug&mdash;no doubt, too,
with the philosophy of the drug victim who has
just had his drug&mdash;he turned away. In silence he
rolled down his sleeves, put on his fur coat, took
his place at the wheel, and, turning the car, started
back through the clearing fog toward the far lights
of the city.</p>

<p>It was a long ride and a silent one. At his wheel
Dillon sat motionless, his jaws set, his eyes staring
straight ahead. His driving, I noticed, was much
more careful than on our outward ride. Not once
did I see Grace Morris look at him. Once or twice
she shivered, as if she felt cold. When we were
on the ferry-boat Dillon turned and spoke to
her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I lost my temper," he said. "I suppose&mdash;your
manner seems to mean&mdash;that&mdash;I've lost
everything."</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Morris did not reply. Under
the robe her hand slipped into mine and clung there,
as if in a lonely world she suddenly felt the need of
a human touch.</p>

<p>"Poor old Herbert," she said, then, very gently.
"I'm afraid we've both lost everything. This has
been a nightmare, but&mdash;I needed it."</p>

<p>There was absolute finality in her voice. Without
a word the young man turned from her and sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
staring at the river lights before us. Miss Morris
pressed my hand.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take you home with me," she announced.
She took out her watch and looked at it.
"Quarter to three," she murmured. "What a
night!" And after a moment she added under her
breath, "And what an escape!"</p>

<p>She threw back her shoulders with a gesture as
energetic as if at the same time she had cast off some
intolerable burden. Then she added, in her cool,
cynical fashion, "It's only fair, you know, that after
such a vigil your drooping spirit should be refreshed
by the rain of my mother's grateful tears&mdash;not to
speak of Godfrey's!"</p>

<h2>VIII<br />

<span class="s08">MARIA ANNUNCIATA</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
It had been a trying day in the <i>Searchlight</i> office.
Godfrey Morris, our assistant feature editor, was
ill, and much of his work had devolved on me.
From ten o'clock in the morning I had steadily
read copy and "built heads," realizing as my blue
pencil raced over the sheets before me that my associates
would resent the cutting of their stories and
that Colonel Cartwell would freely condemn the
heads. It was a tradition in Park Row that no
human being save himself had ever built a newspaper
head which satisfied our editor-in-chief, and
his nightly explosions of rage over those on the
proofs that came to his desk jarred even the firm
walls of the <i>Searchlight</i> building.</p>

<p>To-day I sympathized with Colonel Cartwell, for
as I bent wearily over my desk, cutting, rewriting,
adding to the pile of edited copy before me, a scare-head
in a newspaper I had received that morning
from my home city swung constantly before my
tired eyes. It was plain that the ambitious Western
editor had been taking lessons in head-building from
the <i>Searchlight</i> itself, and was offering us the tribute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of humble imitation; for, in the blackest type he
could select, and stretching across two columns of
the <i>Sentinel's</i> first page, were these startling lines:</p>

<p class="center">From City Room to Convent Cell</p>

<p class="center">Miss May Iverson, Daughter of General John Lamar Iverson of
This City, to Take the Vows of a Nun of the Sacred Cross</p>

<p>The article which followed was illustrated with
photographs of my father, of me, and of the convent
from which I had graduated nearly four years ago. It
sketched my career as a reporter on the New York
<i>Searchlight</i>, mentioned my newspaper work and my
various magazine stories with kindly approval, and
stated that my intention when I graduated at eighteen
had been to enter the convent at twenty-one, but
that in deference to the wishes of my father I had
consented to wait another year. This time of probation
was almost over, the <i>Sentinel</i> added, and it was
"now admitted" that Miss Iverson, "despite the
brilliant promise of her journalistic career," would
be one of the thirty novices who entered the convent
of St. Catharine in July.</p>

<p>All this I had read only once before thrusting the
<i>Sentinel</i> out of sight under the mass of copy on my
desk. Now, word by word, it returned to me as I
built the heads that were to startle our reading public
in the morning. Around me the usual sounds of
the city room swelled steadily into the familiar
symphony of our work. Typewriters clicked and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
rattled, telephone bells kept up their insistent summons,
the presses, now printing the final evening
editions, sent from far below their deep and steady
purr, while through it all the voices of Farrell and
Hurd cut their incisive way, like steamboat whistles
in a fog, to members of the staff. It was an hour
I loved, even as I loved the corresponding hour at
St. Catharine's, when students and nuns knelt together
in the dim, beautiful convent chapel while the
peace of benediction fell upon our souls. I wanted
both the convent and my work. I could not have
them both. And even now, toward the end of my
fourth year of professional life, I was still uncertain
which I was to choose. For months I had been hesitating,
the helpless victim of changing moods, of
conflicting desires. Now, I realized, there must be
an end to these. The article in the <i>Sentinel</i> had
brought matters to a focus. In one way or the other,
and for all time, I must decide my problem.</p>

<p>It was six o'clock when I sent down the last pages
of copy, closed my desk, and walked out of the
<i>Searchlight</i> building to find myself in an unfamiliar
world. Around me lay the worst fog New York
had ever known&mdash;a fog so dense that the forms of
my fellow pedestrians were almost lost in it, though
I could hear their voices on every side. From the
near-by river the anxious warnings of horns and
whistles came to my ears thickly, as if through padded
walls. The elevated station I had to reach was
less than a block away, but to-night no friendly eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
of light winked at me from it, and twice as I walked
cautiously forward I was jostled by vague bulks from
which came short laughs and apologies as they groped
their way past me.</p>

<p>It was an uncanny experience, but it seemed, in
my present mood, merely a fitting accompaniment
to my own mental chaos. Resolutely I tried to
steady my thoughts to pull myself together. I knew
every inch of the little journey to the station. In
a few moments more, I reflected, I would be comfortably
seated in an elevated train, and within half
an hour, if all went normally, I would be safely at
home and dressing for dinner. It was pleasant to
remember that I had made no engagement for that
evening. I could dine alone, slowly and luxuriously,
with an open book before me if I cared to add that
last sybaritic touch to my comfort&mdash;and later I
could dawdle before my big open fire, with a reading-lamp
and half a dozen new magazines wooing me at
my elbow. Or I could take up my problem and settle
it before I went to bed.</p>

<p>My groping feet touched the lowest step of the
elevated stairs. I put my hand forward to raise
my skirt for the ascent, and simultaneously, as it
seemed, a cold hand slipped through the fog and slid
into mine, folding around two of my fingers. It
was a very tiny hand&mdash;almost a baby's hand.
Startled, I looked down. Something small and plump
was pressing against my knee, and as I bent to examine
it closely I saw that it was a child&mdash;a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
girl three or four years old, apparently lost, but
obviously unafraid. Through the mist, as I knelt
to bring her face on a level with my own, a pair of
big and wonderful brown eyes looked steadily into
mine, while a row of absurdly small teeth shone upon
me in a shy but trustful smile.</p>

<p>"Fine-kine-rady," remarked a wee voice in clear,
dispassionate tones.</p>

<p>Impulsively I gave the intrepid adventurer a
friendly hug. "Why, you blessed infant!" I exclaimed.
"What are you doing here all alone?
Where do you live? Where's your mama?"</p>

<p>Still kneeling, I waited for an answer, but none
came. The soft little body of the new-comer leaned
confidingly against my shoulder. A small left hand
played with a button on my coat; its mate still
clung firmly to my fingers. The child's manner was
that of pleased acceptance of permanent and agreeable
conditions. Into the atmosphere of well-being
and dignified reserve which she created, my repeated
question projected itself almost with an effect of
rudeness. On its second repetition it evoked a response,
though merely an echo.</p>

<p>"Fine-kine-rady," repeated the young stranger,
patiently. She continued her absorbing occupation
of twirling my coat button while I pondered
over the cryptic utterance. It meant nothing to me.</p>

<p>"She's certainly lost," I thought. "I wonder if
Casey would remember her if he saw her."</p>

<p>I peered through the fog, looking for the big Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
policeman whose post for the past two years had been
here at the junction of the three tenement streets
that radiated, spoke-like, from under the elevated
station. He must be somewhere near, I knew, possibly
within ear-shot. I decided to try the effect of
a friendly hail.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh-ho&mdash;Officer Casey!</i>" I called, careful to speak
cheerfully, that the cry might not frighten the child
beside me. "<i>Where&mdash;are&mdash;you?</i>"</p>

<p>After a moment I heard an answering hail; an
instant later the familiar bulk of Casey towered
above me in the mist.</p>

<p>"Who's wantin' me?" he demanded, and then, as
he recognized me: "Hel-<i>lo</i>, Miss Iverson! Sure
ye're not lost, are ye?" he added, facetiously.</p>

<p>"I'm not," I told him, "but I think some one else
is. Do you recognize this youngster? I found her
here just now&mdash;or, rather, she found me."</p>

<p>"Fine-kine-rady," murmured the child, antiphonally.
She had turned her brown velvet eyes on
the policeman in one fleeting glance which seemed
to label and dismiss him. His existence, her manner
plainly said, was no concern of hers. Casey bent
down and surveyed her with interest&mdash;a task made
somewhat difficult by the fact that she was coldly
presenting the back of her head to him and that
the top of it was about on a level with his knee.</p>

<p>"Let's take her up t' the waitin'-room," he suggested,
"an' have a good look at her. Can she walk,
I wonder&mdash;or will I carry her?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>At the words the independent explorer below us
started up the stairs, dragging me with her, her
hand still clinging to my fingers, her short, willing
legs taking one step at a time and subject to an
occasional embarrassing wabble, but on the whole
moving briskly and with the ease of habit.</p>

<p>"She understands English," remarked Casey, as
he admiringly followed her, "an' she's used to stairs.
<i>That's</i> clear."</p>

<p>We found the waiting-room deserted except by
the ticket-seller and the ticket-chopper, who were
languidly discussing the fog. Both took an animated
interest in our appearance, and, when they learned
our mission, eagerly approached the child for minute
inspection of her. In the center of the little circle
we made under the station lamp the mite bore our
regard with the utmost composure, her brown eyes
on my face, her hand still firmly grasping my third
and fourth fingers. She seemed mildly surprised
by this second delay in getting anywhere, but entirely
willing to await the convenience of these
strange beings who were talking so much without
saying anything. The ticket-seller finally summed
up the result of our joint observation.</p>

<p>"Whoever that kid is, she's a peach," he muttered,
in spontaneous tribute to the living picture before us.</p>

<p>She <i>was</i> a peach. Her bare head was covered
with short, upstanding curls, decorated on the left
side with a cheap but carefully tied scarlet bow that
stood out with the vivid effect of a poinsettia against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
black velvet. In her cheeks were two deep dimples,
and a third lurked in the lower right side of her chin,
awaiting only the summons of her shy smile to spring
into life. When she lowered her eyes her curly
black lashes seemed unbelievably long, and when
she raised them again something in their strange
beauty made me catch my breath.</p>

<p>She wore no mittens, though the night was cold,
but her tiny body was buttoned tightly into a worn,
knitted, gray reefer-jacket, under which showed a
neat little woolen skirt and black stockings and
shoes which, though very shabby, revealed no holes.
She was surprisingly clean. She had, indeed, an
effect of having been scrubbed and dressed with
special care and in her best clothes, poor though
they were. Her complexion had the soft, warm
olive tint peculiar to Latin races.</p>

<p>For a long time she bore the close scrutiny of our
four pairs of eyes with her astonishing air of calm
detachment. Then, as the inspection threatened
to be indefinitely prolonged, she became restless and
took refuge against my knee. Also, with an obvious
effort to rise to any social demands the occasion presented,
she produced again the masterpiece of her
limited vocabulary.</p>

<p>"Fine-kine-rady," she murmured, anxiously, and
this time her lips quivered.</p>

<p>"She's Eye-talian," decided Casey, sagely, "an'
'tis a sure thing she lives somewhere near. Hasn't
<i>anny</i> of yez set eyes on her before? Think, now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>Hopefully he and I gazed at the station employees,
but both heads shook a solemn negative. The light
of a sudden inspiration illumined the Celtic features
of Casey.</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye what we'll do," he announced. "'Tis
plain she's strayed from home. I c'u'd take her t'
th' station an' let her folks come fur her&mdash;but that's
the long way t' do ut. There's a shorter wan. 'Tis
this."</p>

<p>He tried to draw me to one side, but the little
man&oelig;uver was not successful. Tightening her grasp
on my fingers, the object of our solicitude promptly
accompanied us. Casey lowered his voice to a whisper
which was like the buzzing of a giant bee.</p>

<p>"I'll take her back to the fut of th' stairs an'
<i>lave</i> her," he pronounced. "She'll start home, an'
she'll find her way like a burrd. Av course," he
added, hastily, apparently observing a lack of response
in my expression, "I'll folly her an' watch
her. Av she don't find th' place, I'll take her t' th'
station. But she <i>will</i>. Lave it to her."</p>

<p>I hesitated. "I suppose that's the best plan,"
I unwillingly agreed, at last. "Probably her mother
is half frightened to death already. But&mdash;couldn't
we lead her home?"</p>

<p>Casey shook his head. "Not an inch w'u'd she
budge, that wan," he declared, "unless she was on
her own. But lave her be, an' she'll find her way.
They're wise, thim young Eye-talians. Come, now."</p>

<p>He took the child's free hand and tried to draw her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
away. A pathetic wail burst from her. Frantically,
with both arms she clasped my knee. Her poise,
so perfect until now, deserted her wholly, as if she
had finally decided to admit to an unfeeling world
that after all there was a limit to the self-control of
one of her tender age.</p>

<p>"Fine-kine-rady," she sobbed, while great tears
formed and fell from the brown eyes she still kept
fixed on my face, a look of incredulous horror dawning
in them.</p>

<p>"I simply cannot send her away," I confessed
to Casey, desperately. "It seems so heartless. I'll
go with her."</p>

<p>Officer Casey was a patient man, but he was also
a firm one. "Now, see here, Miss Iverson," he urged.
"You've got sinse. Use ut. 'Tis just a fancy she's
takin' t' ye, an' sure I'm th' last t' blame her," he
added, gallantly. "But think av th' child's good.
Ain't her mother raisin' th' roof over her head somewhere
this minute?" he added, with deep craft.
"Wud ye be killin' th' poor woman wid anxiety?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Again I gave way. "But you won't
lose sight of her for one second, will you?" I demanded.
"You know if you did, in this fog&mdash;"</p>

<p>Casey turned upon me the look of one who suffers
and forbears. "W'u'd ye think ut?" he asked, coldly.
"An' me wit' kids o' me own? But I'll make her
<i>think</i> I've left her," he added. "I'll have to."</p>

<p>There seemed nothing to do but try his plan.
Holding fast to the mental picture of the anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
mother "raising the roof" somewhere in the neighborhood,
I gently pried loose the child's convulsively
clinging fingers and turned away. The wail
and then the sobs that followed wrung my heart.
Casey picked up the frightened, almost frantic baby
and started down the stairs, while I followed at a
safe distance to watch their descent. As they went
I heard him talking to and coaxing the small burden
he carried, his rich Irish voice full of friendly cajolery,
while, as if in sole but eloquent rebuttal of all
he said, the shrill treble refrain, "Fine-kine-rady,"
came back to me sobbingly from the mist.</p>

<p>At the foot of the steps he set the child on her feet,
told her to "go home now like a good wan," and
disappeared under the stairway. I crept down the
steps as far as I dared, and watched. The forlorn
little wanderer, left alone in a fog that was alarming
many grown-ups that night, stood still for a moment
staring around her, as if trying to get her bearings. A
final sob or two came from her. Then in another instant
she had turned and trotted away, moving so fast
that, though I immediately ran down the remaining
steps and followed her, I could hardly keep her in
sight. A little ahead of me I saw Casey hurriedly
cross the street and shadow the tiny figure. I pursued
them both, keeping my eyes on the child. I
trusted Casey&mdash;indeed, my respect for his judgment
had increased enormously during the last two minutes&mdash;but
I felt that I must see for myself what
happened to that baby.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>Like wraiths the two figures in front of me hurried
through the fog, so close now that they almost
touched, Casey unaware of my presence, the child
unconscious of us both. Not once, from the time
she started, had the little thing looked back. She
made her way swiftly and surely along the dingy
tenement street that stretched off to the right; and
at a certain door she stopped, hesitated a moment,
and finally entered. Casey promptly followed her.</p>

<p>For a moment I stood hesitating, tempted to return
to the station and resume my interrupted journey
home. The little episode had already delayed
me half an hour, and it seemed clear that the child
was now safe. Surely nothing more could be done.
Yet even as these logical reflections occurred to
me I entered the door, impelled by an impulse which
I did not stop to analyze, but which I never afterward
ceased to bless. The heavy, typical smell of
a tenement building rose to meet me, intensified
by the dampness of the night. It seemed incredible
that anything so exquisite as that baby could belong
to such a place; but, looking up, I saw her already
near the head of a long flight of dirty steps
that rose from the dimly lighted hall. Casey, moving
as quietly as his heavy boots permitted, was at the
bottom. I waited until he, too, had climbed the
uneven staircase. Then I followed them both.</p>

<p>At the right of the stairs, off a miserable hall lit
by one dim, blinking gas-jet, was an open door,
which the child had evidently just entered. As I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
paused for breath on the top step I caught a glimpse
of Casey's rubber coat also vanishing across the
threshold. I slipped back into the shadow of the
hall and waited. What I wanted was to hear the
reassuring tones of human voices, and I found myself
listening for these with suspended breath and
straining ears; but for a long moment I heard nothing
at all. I realized now that there was no light
in the room, and this suddenly seemed odd to me.
Then I heard Casey's voice, speaking to the child
with a new note in it&mdash;a note of tense excitement
that made my heart-beats quicken. The next instant
I, too, was in the room.</p>

<p>Casey stood under the single gas-bracket, striking
a match. As I went toward him, the light flickered
up, dimly revealing a clean, bleak room, whose only
furniture was a bed, a broken chair, and a small
gas-stove. On the chair lay an empty tin cup and
a spoon. The child, her back to both her visitors,
stood beside the bed. Characteristically, though
Casey had spoken to her, she ignored his presence.
She was whimpering a little under her breath, and
pulling with both hands at something that lay before
her, rigid and unresponsive.</p>

<p>With a rush I crossed the room, and the desolate
mite of humanity at the bed turned to stare at
me, blinking in the sudden light. For an instant
her wet brown eyes failed to recognize me. In the
next, with an ecstatic, indescribably pathetic little
cry, she lurched into the arms I opened to her. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
could not speak, but I sat down on the floor and held
her close, my tears falling on her curly head with
its brave red bow. For a moment more the silence
held. Then the child drew a long, quivering breath
and patiently uttered again her parrot-like refrain.</p>

<p>"Fine-kine-rady," she murmured, brokenly.</p>

<p>Casey, his cap in his hand, stood looking down
upon the silent figure on the bed. "Starvation, most
likely," he hazarded. "She's bin dead fur an hour,
maybe more," he mused aloud. "An' she's laid herself
out, d'ye mind. Whin she found death comin'
she drew her feet together, an' crost her hands on
her breast, an' shut her eyes. They do ut sometimes,
whin they know they's no wan to do ut for thim.
But first she washed an' dressed her child in uts
best an' sint ut out&mdash;so ut w'u'dn't be scairt. D'ye
know th' woman?" he added. "Have ye ivir seen
her? It seems t' me <i>I</i> have!"</p>

<p>Holding the baby tight, her head against my
shoulder, that she might not see what I did, I went
forward and looked at the wasted face. There was
something vaguely familiar about the black hair-line
on the broad, Madonna-like brow, about the
exquisitely shaped nose, the sunken cheeks, the
pointed chin. For a long moment I looked at them
while memory stirred in me and then awoke.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, at last. "I remember her now.
Many evenings last month I saw her standing at the
foot of the elevated stairs when I was going home.
She wore a little shawl over her head&mdash;that's why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
I didn't recognize her at once. She never begged,
but she took what one gave her. I always gave her
something. She was evidently very poor. I remember
vaguely that she had a child with her&mdash;this
one, of course. I hardly noticed either of them
as I swept by. One's always in a rush, you know,
to get home, and, unfortunately, there are so many
beggars!"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Casey. "I remember her now,
too."</p>

<p>"If only I had realized how ill she was," I reflected
aloud, miserably, "or stopped to think of the
child. She called me 'kind lady.' Oh, Casey! And
I let her starve!"</p>

<p>"Hush now," said Casey, consolingly. "Sure how
could ye know? Some of thim that's beggin' has
more than you have!"</p>

<p>"But she called me 'kind lady,'" I repeated.
"And I let her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fine-kine-rady," murmured the child, drowsily,
as if hearing and responding to a cue. She was quiet
and well content, again playing with a coat-button;
but she piped out her three words as if they were
part of a daily drill and the word of command had
been uttered. Casey and I looked at each other,
then dropped our eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="illo191" id="illo191"></a>
<img src="images/illo191.jpg" width="365" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">"D'ye Know the Woman?" He Said</span></p>
</div>

<p>"<i>Find kind lady</i>," I translated at last. Then I
broke down, in the bitterest storm of tears that I
have ever known. Beside me Casey stood guard,
silent and unhappy. It was the whimper of the child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
that recalled me to myself and her. She was growing
frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, Casey," I said again, when I had soothed
her, "do you realize that the poor woman sent this
baby out into New York to-night on the one chance
in a million that she might see me at the station
and that I would remember her?"</p>

<p>"What else c'u'd the poor creature do?" muttered
Casey. "I guess she wasn't dependin' on her neighbors
much. 'Tis easy to see that ivery stick o' furniture
an' stitch o' clothes, ixcept th' child's, was
pawned. Besides, thim tiniment kids is wise," he
repeated. His blue eyes dwelt on the baby with a
brooding speculation in their depths. "She's sleepy,"
he muttered, "but she's not starved. Th' mother
fed her t' th' last, an' wint without herself; an' she
kep' her warm. They do that sometimes, too."</p>

<p>With quick decision he put on his cap and started
for the door. "I'll telephone me report," he said,
briskly. "Will ye be waitin' here till I come back?
Thin we'll take th' mother t' th' morgue an' the
child t' th' station."</p>

<p>"Oh no, we won't," I told him, gently. "We'll
see that the mother has proper burial. As for this
baby, I'm going to take care of her until I find an
ideal home for her. I know women who will thank
God for her. I wish," I added, absently&mdash;"I wish I
could keep her myself."</p>

<p>Casey turned on me a face that was like a smiling
full moon. "'Tis lucky th' child is to have ye for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
a friend. But she'll be a raysponsibil'ty," he reminded
me, "and an expinse."</p>

<p>I kissed the tiny hand that clung to mine. "That
won't worry me," I declared. "Why, do you know,
Casey"&mdash;I drew the soft little body closer to me&mdash;"I
feel that if I worked for her a thousand years I
could never make up to this baby for that horrible
moment when I turned her adrift again&mdash;after she
had found me."</p>

<p class="p2">Two hours later my waif of the fog, having been
fed and tubbed and tucked into one of my nightgowns,
reposed in my bed, and, still beatifically
clutching a cookie, sank into a restful slumber. My
maid, a "settled" Norwegian who had been with
me for two years, had welcomed her with hospitable
rapture. A doctor had pronounced her in excellent
physical condition. A trained nurse, hastily summoned
to supervise her bath, her supper, and her
general welfare, had already drawn up an impressive
plan indicating the broad highway of hygienic infant
living. Now, for the dozenth time, we were examining
a scrap of paper which I had found in a tiny bag
around the child's neck when I undressed her. It
bore a brief message written in a wavering, foreign
hand:</p>

<p class="center">
Maria Annunciata Zamati<br />
3½ years old</p>

<p class="center">Parents dead. No relations. Be good to her and God will be
good to you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>Besides this in the little bag was a narrow gold
band, wrapped in a bit of paper that read:</p>

<p class="center">
Her mother's wedding-ring.</p>

<p>Broodingly I hung over the short but poignant
record. "Maria Annunciata," I repeated. "What
a beautiful name! Three and a half years old!
What an adorable age! No relations. No one can
ever take her from us! I shall be her godmother
and her best friend, whoever adopts her. And I'll
keep her till the right mother comes for her, if it takes
the rest of my life."</p>

<p>The doctor laughed and bade us good night, after
a final approving look at the sleeping baby in the
big bed. The trained nurse departed with evident
reluctance for her room.</p>

<p>The telephone beside my bed clicked warningly,
then tinkled. As I took up the receiver a familiar
voice came to me over the wire.</p>

<p>"Is that you, May?" it said. "This is Josephine
Morgan. Did you get a dinner invitation from me
yesterday? Not hearing from you, I've been trying
to get you on the telephone all evening, but no one
answered."</p>

<p>"I know," I said, cheerfully. "Awfully sorry.
I've been busy. I've got a baby."</p>

<p>Maria Annunciata stirred in her sleep. Speaking
very softly, that I might not awaken her, I told
Josephine the story of my adventure.</p>

<p>"Come and see her soon," I ended. "I mustn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
talk any more. Annunciata is here beside me. She's
absolutely different from any other child in the world.
Good night."</p>

<p>I undressed slowly, stopping at intervals to study
the pleasing effect of Maria Annunciata's short
black curls on the pillow. At last, moving very
carefully for fear of disturbing her, I crept into bed.
As promptly as if the yielding of the mattress had
been a signal that set her tiny body in motion, Maria
Annunciata awoke, smiled at me, cuddled into the
curve of my left arm, reached up, and firmly grasped
my left ear. Then, with a long sigh of ineffable content,
she dropped back into slumber.</p>

<p>The only light was the soft glow of an electric
bulb behind an amber shade. The button that controlled
it was within easy reach of my hand; a touch
would have plunged the room into darkness. But
I did not press the little knob. Instead, I lay for
a long, long time looking at the sleeping child beside
me.</p>

<p>There was a soft knock at the door. It opened
quietly and my servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Morgan are outside," she whispered.
"They say they've come to see the baby."</p>

<p>"But," I gasped, "it's after eleven o'clock!"</p>

<p>"I know. Mrs. Morgan said they couldn't wait
till morning. Shall I show her in?"</p>

<p>I hesitated. I felt a sense of unreasonable annoyance,
almost of fear. "Yes," I said, at last, "let
her come in."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>Josephine Morgan came in with a soft little feminine
rush. Something of the atmosphere of the
great world in which she lived came with her as far
as the bedside, then dropped from her like a garment
as she knelt beside us and kissed me, her eyes on
Maria Annunciata's sleeping face.</p>

<p>"Oh, the darling, the lamb!" she breathed. "She's
the most exquisite thing I ever saw! And the pluck
of her! George says she ought to have a Carnegie
medal." Still kneeling, she bent over the child, her
beautiful face quivering with feeling. "What do
you know about her family?" she asked.</p>

<p>With a gesture I indicated the scrap of paper and
the ring that lay on my dressing-table. "There's
the whole record," I murmured.</p>

<p>She rose and examined them, standing very still
for a moment afterward, apparently in deep thought.
Then, still holding them, she returned to the bedside
and with a quick but indescribably tender
movement gathered Maria Annunciata into her
arms. "Let me show her to George," she whispered.</p>

<p>I consented, and she carried the sleeping baby
into the next room. I heard their voices and an occasional
low laugh. A strange feeling of loneliness
settled upon me. In a few moments she came back,
her face transfigured. Bending, she put the child
in bed and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"May," she said, quietly, "George and I want her.
Will you give her to us?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>The demand was so sudden that I could not speak.
She looked at me, her eyes filling.</p>

<p>"We've been looking for a little daughter for two
years," she added. "We've visited dozens of institutions."</p>

<p>"But," I stammered, "I wanted to keep her myself&mdash;for
a while, anyway."</p>

<p>She smiled at me. "Why, you will&mdash;" she began,
and stopped.</p>

<p>"You may have her," I said, quietly.</p>

<p>She kissed me. "We'll make her happy," she
promised. "I suppose," she added, "we couldn't
take her away <i>to-night</i>? Of course the first thing in
the morning will <i>do</i>," she concluded, hastily, as she
met my indignant gaze.</p>

<p>"Josephine Morgan," I gasped, "I never met
such selfishness! Of course you can't have her to-night.
You can't have her in the morning, either.
You've got to adopt her legally, with red seals and
things. It will take lots of time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan laughed, passing a tender finger
through one of Maria Annunciata's short curls.
"We'll do it," she said. "We'll do anything. And
we're going to be in New York all winter, so you can
be with her a great deal while she's getting used to us.
Now I'll go." But she lingered, making a pretext of
tucking in the bedclothes around us. "You've seen
the <i>Sentinel</i>," she asked, "with that story about you?"</p>

<p>I shook my head at her. "Don't, please," I
begged. "We'll talk about that to-morrow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>She kissed the deep dimple in Maria Annunciata's
left cheek. "Good night," she said, again. "You'll
never know how happy you have made us."</p>

<p>The door closed behind her. I raised my hand
and pressed the button above my head. Around
me the friendly darkness settled, and a silence as
warm and friendly. In the hollow of my neck the
face of Maria Annunciata rested, a short curl tickling
my cheek. I recalled "the great silence" that
fell over the convent at nine o'clock when the
lights went out, but to-night the reflection did not
bring its usual throb of homesickness and longing.
Relaxed, content, I lay with eyes wide open, looking
into the future. Without struggle, without self-analysis,
but firmly and for all time, I had decided
<i>not</i> to be a nun.</p>

<h2>IX<br />

<span class="s08">THE REVOLT OF TILDY MEARS</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Every seat in the primitive town hall was occupied,
and a somber frieze of Dakota plainsmen
and their sad-faced wives decorated the rough,
unpainted sides of the building. On boxes in the
narrow aisles, between long rows of pine boards on
which were seated the early arrivals, late-comers
squatted discontentedly, among them a dozen women
carrying fretful babies, to whom from time to
time they addressed a comforting murmur as they
swung them, cradle-fashion, in their tired arms.</p>

<p>The exercises of the evening had not yet begun,
but almost every eye in the big, silent, patient assemblage
was fixed on a woman, short and stout,
with snow-white hair and a young and vivid face,
who had just taken her place on the platform, escorted
by a self-conscious official of the little town.
Every one in that gathering had heard of Dr. Anna
Harland; few had yet heard her speak, but all knew
what she represented: "new-fangled notions about
women"&mdash;women's rights, woman suffrage, feminism,
unsettling ideas which threatened to disturb
the peace of minds accustomed to run in well-worn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
grooves. Many of the men and women in her audience
had driven twenty, thirty, or forty miles across
the plains to hear her, but there was no unanimity
in the expressions with which they studied her now
as she sat before them. In the men's regard were
curiosity, prejudice, good-humored tolerance, or a
blend of all three. The women's faces held a different
meaning: pride, affectionate interest, admiration
tinged with hope; and here and there a hint of something
deeper, a wireless message that passed from
soul to soul.</p>

<p>At a melodeon on the left of the platform a pale
local belle, who had volunteered her services, awaited
the signal to play the opening chords of the song
that was to precede the speaker's address. In
brackets high on the rough walls a few kerosene
lamps vaguely illumined the scene, while from the
open night outside came the voices of cowboys
noisily greeting late arrivals and urging them to
"go on in an' git a change of heart!"</p>

<p>The musician received her signal&mdash;a nod from the
chairman of the evening&mdash;and the next moment
the voices of a relieved and relaxed audience were
heartily swelling the familiar strains of "The Battle
Hymn of the Republic." As the men and women
before her sang on, Dr. Harland watched them, the
gaze of the brilliant dark eyes under her straight
black brows keen and intent. Even yet she had
not decided what she meant to say to these people.
Something in the music, something in the atmosphere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
would surely give her a cue, she felt, before
she began to speak.</p>

<p>Sitting near her on the platform, I studied both
her and her audience. The Far West and its people
were new to me; so was this great leader of the
woman's cause. But it behooved me to know her
and to know her well, for I had accompanied her on
this Western campaign for the sole purpose of writing
a series of articles on her life and work, to be
published in the magazine of which I had recently
been appointed assistant editor. During our long
railroad journeys and drives over hills and plains
she had talked to me of the past. Now, I knew,
I was to see her again perform the miracle at which
I had not yet ceased to marvel&mdash;the transformation
of hundreds of indifferent or merely casually interested
persons into a mass of shouting enthusiasts,
ready to enlist under her yellow banner and
follow wherever she led.</p>

<p>To-night, as she rose and for a moment stood
silent before her audience, I could see her, as usual,
gathering them up, drawing them to her by sheer
force of magnetism, before she spoke a word.</p>

<p>"My friends," she began, in the beautiful voice
whose vibrating contralto notes reached every person
in the great hall, "last Monday, at Medora,
I was asked by a missionary who is going to India
to send a message to the women of that land. I said
to him, 'Tell them the world was made for women,
too.' To-night I am here to give you the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
message. The world is women's, too. The West
is women's, too. You have helped to make it, you
splendid, pioneer women, who have borne with your
husbands the heat and burden of the long working-days.
You have held down your claims through
the endless months of Western winters, while your
men were away; you have toiled with them in the
fields; you have endured with them the tragedies
of cyclones, of droughts, of sickness, of starvation.
If woman's work is in the home alone, as our opponents
say it is, you have been most unwomanly.
For you have remained in the home only long enough
to bear your children, to care for them, to feed them
and your husbands. The rest of the time you have
done a man's work in the West. The toil has been
yours as well as man's; the reward of such toil
should be shared by you. The West is yours, too.
Now it holds work for you even greater than that
you have done in the past, and I am here to beg you
to begin that work."</p>

<p>The address went on. In the dim light of the
ill-smelling lamps I could see the audience leaning
forward, intent, fascinated. Even among the men
easy tolerance was giving place to eager response;
on row after row of the rough benches the spectators
were already clay in the hands of the speaker,
to be molded, for the moment at least, into the form
she chose to give them. My eyes momentarily
touched, then fastened intently on a face in the third
row on the left. It was the face of a woman&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
little, middle-aged woman of the primitive Western
type&mdash;her graying hair combed straight back from
a high, narrow forehead, her thin lips slightly parted,
the flat chest under her gingham dress rising and
falling with emotion. But my interest was held by
her eyes&mdash;brown eyes, blazing eyes, almost the eyes
of a fanatic. Unswervingly they rested on the
speaker's face, while the strained attention, the
parted lips, the attitude of the woman's quivering
little body betrayed almost uncontrollable excitement.
At that instant I should not have been surprised
to see her spring to her feet and shout, "<i>Alleluia!</i>"</p>

<p>A moment later I realized that Dr. Harland had
seen her, too; that she was, indeed, intensely conscious
of her, and was directing many of her best
points to this absorbed listener. Here was the perfect
type she was describing to her audience&mdash;the
true woman pioneer, who not only worked and
prayed, but who read and thought and aspired.
The men and women under the flickering lights
were by this time as responsive to the speaker's
words as a child to its mother's voice. They laughed,
they wept, they nodded, they sighed. When the
usual collection was taken up they showed true
Western generosity, and when the lecture was over
they crowded forward to shake hands with the
woman leader, and to exhaust their limited vocabulary
in shy tributes to her eloquence. Far on the
outskirts of the wide circle that had formed around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
her I saw the little woman with the blazing eyes,
vainly endeavoring to force her way toward us
through the crowd. Dr. Harland observed her at
the same time and motioned to me.</p>

<p>"Will you ask her to wait, Miss Iverson?" she
asked. "I would like to talk to her before she slips
away." And she added, with her characteristic
twinkle, "That woman would make a perfect 'Exhibit
A' for my lecture."</p>

<p>I skirted the throng and touched the arm of the
little woman just as she had given up hope of reaching
the speaker, and was moving toward the door.
She started and stared at me, almost as if the touch
of my fingers had awakened her from a dream.</p>

<p>"Dr. Harland asks if you will wait a few moments
till the others leave," I told her. "She is anxious
to meet you."</p>

<p>The brown-eyed woman drew in a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Tha's whut I want," she exclaimed, ecstatically,
"but it looked like I couldn't git near her."</p>

<p>We sat down on an empty bench half-way down
the hall, and watched the human stream flow toward
and engulf the lecturer. "Ain't she jest wonderful?"
breathed my companion. "She knows us
women better 'n we know ourselves. She knows all
we done an' how we feel about it. I felt like she was
tellin' them people all my secrets, but I didn't
mind." She hesitated, then added dreamily, "It's
high time men was told whut their women are
thinkin' an' can't say fer themselves."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>In the excited group around the speaker a baby,
held high in its mother's arms to avoid being injured
in the crush, shrieked out a sudden protest.
My new acquaintance regarded it with sympathetic
eyes.</p>

<p>"I've raised six of 'em," she told me. "My oldest
is a girl nineteen. My youngest is a boy of twelve.
My big girl she's lookin' after the house an' the
fam'ly while I'm gone. I druv sixty miles 'cross the
plains to hear Dr. Harland. It took me two days,
an' it's jest about wore out my horse&mdash;but this is
worth it. I ain't had sech a night sence I was a girl."</p>

<p>She looked at me, her brown eyes lighting up
again with their queer, excited fires.</p>

<p>"My Jim he 'most fell dead when I told him I
was comin'," she went on. "But I says to him, 'I
ain't been away from this place one minute in
twenty years,' I says. 'Now I guess you folks can
git 'long without me fer a few days. For, Jim,' I
says, 'ef I don't git away, ef I don't go somewhere
an' have some change, somethin's goin' to snap, an'
I guess it'll be me!'"</p>

<p>"You mean," I exclaimed, in surprise, "that
you've never left your ranch in twenty years?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Not once," she corroborated. "Not fer a minute.
You know whut the summers are&mdash;work, work
from daylight to dark; an' in the winters I had t'
hol' down the claim while Jim he went to the city
an' worked. Sometimes he'd only git home once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
or twice the hull winter. Then when we begin to git
on, seemed like 'twas harder than ever. Jim he
kept addin' more land an' more stock to whut we
had, an' there was more hands to be waited on, an'
the babies come pretty fast. Lately Jim he's gone
to Chicago every year to sell his cattle, but I ain't
bin able to git away till now."</p>

<p>During her eager talk&mdash;a talk that gushed forth
like a long-repressed stream finding a sudden outlet&mdash;she
had been leaning toward me with her arm
on the back of the bench and her shining eyes on
mine. Now, as if remembering her "company manners,"
she sat back stiffly, folded her work-roughened
hands primly in her lap, and sighed with supreme
content.</p>

<p>"My!" she whispered, happily, "I feel like I was
in a diff'rent world. It don't seem possible that
only sixty miles out on the plains that ranch is right
there, an' everything is goin' on without me. An'
here I be, hearin' the music, an' all the folks singin'
together, an' that wonderful woman talkin' like she
did! I feel"&mdash;she hesitated for a comparison, and
then went on, with the laugh of a happy girl&mdash;"I
feel like I was up in a balloon an' on my way to
heaven!"</p>

<p>I forgot the heat of the crowded hall, the smell of
the smoking lamps, the shuffle of hobnailed shoes
on the pine floors, the wails of fretful babies. I
almost felt that I, too, was floating off with this ecstatic
stranger in the balloon of her imagination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>"I see," I murmured. "You're tired of drudgery.
You haven't played enough in all these years."</p>

<p>She swung round again until she faced me, her
sallow cheeks flushed, her eager, brilliant eyes on
mine.</p>

<p>"I ain't played none at all," she said. "I dunno
what play is. An' work ain't the only thing I'm
tired of. I'm tired of everything. I'm tired of everything&mdash;except
this."</p>

<p>Her voice lingered on the last two words. Her
eyes left my face for an instant and followed the
lecturer, of whose white head we obtained a glimpse
from time to time as the crowd opened around her.
Still gazing toward her, but now as if unseeingly,
the plainswoman went on, her voice dropping to a
lower, more confidential note.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of everything," she repeated. "Most
of all, I'm sick of the plains and the sky&mdash;stretching
on and on and on and on, like they do, as if they
was no end to 'em. Sometimes when I'm alone I
stand at my door an' look at 'em an' shake my fists
an' shriek. I begun to think they wasn't anything
but them nowhere. It seemed 's if the little town
back East where I come from was jest a place I
dreamed of&mdash;it couldn't really be. Nothin' <i>could</i>
be 'cept those plains an' the cattle an' the sky.
Then, this spring&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned again to face me.</p>

<p>"I dunno why I'm tellin' you all this," she broke
off, suddenly. "Guess it's because I ain't had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
one to talk to confidential fer so long, an' you look
like you understand."</p>

<p>"I do understand," I told her.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, this spring," she went on, "I begun to
hate everything, same as I hated the plains. I
couldn't exactly hate my children; but it seemed
to me they never did nothin' right, an' I jest had
to keep tellin' myself they was mine, an' they was
young an' didn't understand how they worried me
by things they done. Then the hands drove me
'most crazy. They was one man&mdash;why, jes' to have
that man pass the door made me feel sick, an' yet
I hadn't nothin' again' him, really. An' finally, last
of all, Jim&mdash;even Jim&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice broke. Sudden tears filled her eyes,
quenching for the moment the sparks that burned
there.</p>

<p>"Jim's a good man," she continued, steadily,
after a moment's pause. "He's a good, hard-workin'
man. He's good to me in his way, an' he's good to
the children. But of course he ain't got much
time for us. He never was a talker. He's a worker,
Jim is, an' when night comes he's so tired he falls
asleep over the fire. But everything he done always
seemed pretty near right to me&mdash;till this spring."</p>

<p>Her voice flattened and died on the last three
words. For a moment she sat silent, brooding, a
strange puzzled look in her brown eyes. The crowd
around Dr. Harland was thinning out, and people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
were leaving the hall. We could easily have reached
her now, but I sat still, afraid to dam the verbal
freshet that was following so many frozen winters.</p>

<p>"This spring," she went on, at last, "it jest seems
like I can't bear to have even Jim around." She
checked herself and touched my arm timidly, almost
apologetically. "It's a terrible thing to say,
ain't it?" she almost whispered, and added slowly,
"It's a terrible thing to <i>feel</i>. I can't bear to see him
come into the room. I can't bear the way he eats,
or the way he smokes, or the way he sets down, or
the way he gits up, or the way he breathes. He
does 'em all jest like he always has. They ain't
nothin' wrong with 'em. But I can't bear 'em no
more." She beat her hands together softly, with a
queer, frantic gesture. Her voice took on a note of
rising excitement. "I can't," she gasped. "I can't,
<i>I can't</i>!"</p>

<p>I rose.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, cheerfully. "Dr. Harland is
free now. I want you to talk to her. She can help
you. She's a very wise woman."</p>

<p>A momentary flicker of something I did not recognize
shone in my companion's eyes. Was it doubt
or pity, or both?</p>

<p>"She ain't a married woman, is she?" she asked,
quietly, as she rose and walked down the aisle by
my side.</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"No," I conceded, "she isn't, and neither am I.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
But you know even the Bible admits that of ten
virgins five were wise!"</p>

<p>Her face, somber now, showed no reflection of
my amusement. She seemed to be considering our
claims to wisdom, turning over in her mind the
possibility of help from either of us, and experiencing
a depressing doubt.</p>

<p>"Well, you're women, anyway," she murmured,
at last, a pathetic note of uncertainty lingering in
her voice.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me your name?" I asked, "so that
I may introduce you properly to Dr. Harland?"</p>

<p>"Tildy Mears," she answered, promptly; then
added, with stiff formality, "Mrs. James Mears of
the X. X. M. Ranch."</p>

<p>We were already facing Dr. Harland, and I presented
Mrs. Mears without further delay. The
leader met her with the brilliant smile, the close
hand-clasp, the warm, human sympathy which
rarely failed to thrill the man or woman she was
greeting. Under their influence Mrs. Mears expanded
like a thirsty plant in a gentle shower. Within
five minutes the two women were friends.</p>

<p>"You're at the hotel, of course," Dr. Harland
asked, when she heard of the sixty-mile drive across
the country. "Then you must have supper with
Miss Iverson and me. We always want something
after these long evenings, and I will have it sent up
to our sitting-room, so that we can have a comfortable
talk."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>Half an hour later we were grouped around the
table in the little room, and over the cold meat,
canned peaches, lemonade, and biscuits which formed
our collation Tildy Mears retold her story, adding
innumerable details and intimate touches under the
stimulus of the doctor's interest. At the end of it
Dr. Harland sat for a long moment in silent thought.
Then, from the briskness with which she began to
speak, I knew that she had found some solution of
the human problem before us.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mears," she said, abruptly, and without
any comment on the other's recital, "I wish you
would travel around with us for a fortnight. We're
going to remain in this part of the state, and you
would find our meetings extremely interesting. On
the other hand, you could give me a great deal of
help and information, and, though I cannot offer
you a salary, I will gladly pay your expenses."</p>

<p>This was a plan very characteristic of Dr. Harland,
to whom half-way measures of any kind made no
appeal. I looked at Tildy Mears. For an instant,
under the surprise of the leader's unexpected words,
she had sat still, stunned; in the next, her eyes had
flashed to us one of their ecstatic messages, as if she
had grasped all the other woman's proposition held
of change, of interest, of growth. Then abruptly
the light faded, went out.</p>

<p>"I'd love to," she said, dully, "I'd jest <i>love</i> to!
But of course it ain't possible. Why, I got to start
home to-morrer. Jim," she gulped, bringing out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
the name with an obvious effort, "Jim expecks me
back Sat'day night."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Mrs. Mears"&mdash;Dr. Harland leaned
forward, her compelling eyes deep in those of the
Western woman&mdash;"I'm going to speak to you very
frankly&mdash;as if we were old friends; as if we were
sisters, as, indeed, we are."</p>

<p>Tildy Mears nodded. Her eyes, dull and tired
now, looked trustfully back at the other woman.</p>

<p>"I feel like we are," she agreed. And she added,
"You kin say anything you've a mind to."</p>

<p>"Then I want to say this."</p>

<p>I had never seen Dr. Harland more interested,
more impressive. Into what she was saying to the
forlorn little creature before her she threw all she
had of persuasiveness, of magnetism, and of power.</p>

<p>"If you don't have a change," she continued,
"and a very radical change, you will surely have a
bad nervous breakdown. That is what I want to
save you from. I cannot imagine anything that
would do it more effectively than to campaign with
us for a time, and have the whole current of your
thoughts turned in a new direction. Why, don't you
understand"&mdash;her deep voice was full of feeling; for
the moment at least she was more interested in one
human soul than in hundreds of human votes&mdash;"it
isn't that you have ceased to care for your home
and your family. It's only that your tortured nerves
are crying out against the horrible monotony of
your life. Give them the change they are demanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
and everything else will come right. Go back
and put them through the old strain, and&mdash;well,
I'm afraid everything will go wrong."</p>

<p>As if something in the other's words had galvanized
her into sudden action Mrs. Mears sprang
to her feet. Like a wild thing she circled the room,
beating her hands together.</p>

<p>"I can't go back!" she cried. "I can't go back!
Whut'll I do? Oh, whut'll I do?"</p>

<p>"Do what I am advising you to do."</p>

<p>Dr. Harland's quiet voice steadied the hysterical
woman. Under its calming influence I could see her
pull herself together.</p>

<p>"Write Mr. Mears that you are coming with us,
and give him our advance route, so that he will
know exactly where you are all the time. If your
daughter can manage your home for five days she
can manage it for two weeks. And your little jaunt
need not cost your husband one penny."</p>

<p>"I brought twenty dollars with me," quavered
Tildy Mears.</p>

<p>"Keep it," advised the temporarily reckless leader
of the woman's cause. "When we reach Bismarck
you can buy yourself a new dress and get some little
presents to take home to the children."</p>

<p>Tildy Mears stopped her reckless pacing of the
room and stood for a moment very still, her eyes
fixed on a worn spot in the rug at her feet.</p>

<p>"I reckon I will," she then said, slowly. "Sence
you ask me, I jest reckon I'll stay."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>The next evening, during her remarks to the gathering
she was then addressing, Dr. Harland abruptly
checked herself.</p>

<p>"But there is some one here who knows more
about that than I do," she said, casually, referring
to a point she was covering. "Mrs. Mears, who is
on the platform with me to-night, is one of you.
She knows from twenty years of actual experience
what I am learning from study and observation.
She can tell you better than I can how many buckets
of water a plainsman's wife carries into an unpiped
ranch during the day. Will you tell us, Mrs. Mears?"</p>

<p>She asked a few questions, and hesitatingly, stammeringly
at first, the panic-stricken plainswoman
answered her. Then a woman in the audience spoke
up timidly to compare notes, and in five minutes
more Dr. Harland was sitting quietly in the background
while Tildy Mears, her brown eyes blazing
with interest and excitement, talked to her fellow
plainswomen about the problems she and they were
meeting together.</p>

<p>Seeing the success of Dr. Harland's experiment,
I felt an increased respect for that remarkable woman.
She had known that this would happen; she
had realized, as I had not, that Tildy Mears could
talk to others as simply and as pregnantly as to us,
and that her human appeal to her sister workers
would be far greater than any even Anna Harland
herself could make. One night she described a stampede
in words that made a slow chill run the length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of my spine. Half an hour later she was discussing
"hired hands," with a shrewd philosophy and a
quaint humor that drew good-natured guffaws from
"hired hands" themselves as well as from their
employers in the audience.</p>

<p>Within the next few days Tildy Mears became a
strong feature of our campaign. Evening after
evening, in primitive Dakota towns, her self-consciousness
now wholly gone, she supplemented Dr.
Harland's lectures by a talk to her sister women,
so simple, so homely, so crudely eloquent that its
message reached every heart. During the days she
studied the suffrage question, reading and rereading
the books we had brought with us, and asking as
many questions as an eager and precocious child.
Openly and unabashedly Dr. Harland gloried in
her.</p>

<p>"Why, she's a born orator," she told me one day,
almost breathlessly. "She's a feminine Lincoln.
There's no limit to her possibilities. I'd like to take
her East. I'd like to educate her&mdash;train her. Then
she could come back here and go through the West
like a whirlwind."</p>

<p>The iridescent bubble was floating so beautifully
that it seemed a pity to prick it; but I did, with a
callous reminder.</p>

<p>"How about her home?" I suggested&mdash;"and her
children? and her husband?"</p>

<p>Dr. Harland frowned and bit her lip.</p>

<p>"Humph!" she muttered, her voice taking on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
flat notes of disappointment and chagrin. "Humph!
I'd forgotten them."</p>

<p>For a moment she stood reflecting, readjusting
her plans to a scale which embraced the husband,
the home, and the children of her protégée. Then
her brow cleared, her irresistible twinkle broke over
her face; she smiled like a mischievous child.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten them," she repeated. "Maybe"&mdash;this
with irrepressible hopefulness&mdash;"maybe
Tildy will, too!"</p>

<p>That Tildy did nothing of the kind was proved
to us all too soon. Six days had passed, and the
growing fame of Mrs. Mears as a suffrage speaker
was attracting the attention of editors in the towns
we visited. It reached its climax at a mass-meeting
in Sedalia, where for an hour the little woman
talked to an audience of several hundred, making
all Dr. Harland's favorite points in her own simpler,
homelier words, while the famous leader of the cause
beamed on her proudly from the side of the stage.
After the doctor's speech the two women held an
informal reception, which the Mayor graced, and
to which the Board of Aldermen also lent the light
of their presence. These high dignitaries gave
most of their attention to our leader; she could
answer any question they wished to ask, as well as
many others they were extremely careful not to
bring up. But the women in the audience, the babies,
the growing boys and girls&mdash;all these turned to
Tildy Mears. From the closing words of her speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
until she disappeared within the hotel she was followed
by an admiring throng. As I caught the
final flash of her brown eyes before her bedroom
engulfed her it seemed to me that she looked pale
and tired. She had explained that she wanted no
supper, but before I went to bed, hearing her still
moving around her room, I rapped at her door.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like a sandwich?" I asked, when
she had opened it. "And a glass of lemonade?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. Then, seeing that I had brought
these modest refreshments on a tray, she stepped
back and allowed me to pass in. There was an unusual
self-consciousness in her manner, an unusual
bareness in the effect of the room. The nails on the
wall had been stripped of her garments. On the
floor lay an open suit-case closely packed.</p>

<p>"Why!" I gasped. "Why are you packing?
We're going to stay here over to-morrow, you know."</p>

<p>For an instant she stood silent before me, looking
like a child caught in some act of disobedience by
a relentless parent. Then her head went up.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, quietly. "I'm packed. I'm
goin' home!"</p>

<p>"Going home!" I repeated, stupidly. It seemed
to me that all I could do was to echo her words.
"When?" I finally brought out.</p>

<p>"To-morrer mornin'." She spoke almost defiantly.
"I wanted to go to-night," she added,
"but there wasn't no train. I got to go back an'
start from Dickinson, where I left my horse."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"But why?" I persisted. "<i>Why?</i> I thought you
were going to be with us another week at least?"</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;she drew out the word consideringly.
Then, on a sudden resolve, she gave her explanation.
"They was a man in the fourth row to-night that
looked like Jim."</p>

<p>"Yes?" I said, and waited. "Was he Mr. Mears?"
I asked, at last.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She knelt, and closed and locked the suit-case.</p>

<p>"He looked like Jim," she repeated, as if that
ended the discussion.</p>

<p>For an instant the situation was too complicated
for me. Then, in a flash of understanding, I remembered
that only the week before I had been
made suddenly homesick for New York by one
fleeting glimpse of a man whose profile was like
that of Godfrey Morris. Without another word I
sought Dr. Harland and broke the news to her in
two pregnant sentences.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mears is going home to-morrow morning.
She saw a man at the meeting to-night who looked
like her husband."</p>

<p>Dr. Harland, who was preparing for bed, laid
down the hair-brush she was using, slipped a wrapper
over her nightgown, and started for Mrs. Mears's
room. I followed. Characteristically, our leader
disdained preliminaries.</p>

<p>"But, my dear woman," she exclaimed, "you
can't leave us in the lurch like this. You're announced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to speak in Sweetbriar and Mendan and
Bismarck within the coming week."</p>

<p>"He looked jest like Jim," murmured Tildy Mears,
in simple but full rebuttal. She was standing with
her back to the door, and she did not turn as we
entered. Her eyes were set toward the north, where
her home was, and her children and Jim. Her manner
dismissed Sweetbriar, Mendan, and Bismarck
as if they were the flowers of last year. Suddenly
she wheeled, crossed the room, and caught Dr.
Harland by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Woman," she cried, "I'm homesick. Can't ye
understand that, even ef you ain't got a home an'
a husband ye been neglectin' fer days, like I have?
I'm homesick." Patiently she brought out her refrain
again. "The man looked jest like Jim," she
ended.</p>

<p>She turned away, and with feverish haste put her
case on a chair, and her jacket and hat on the case,
topping the collection with an old pair of driving-gloves.
The completeness of this preparation seemed
to give her some satisfaction. She continued with
more animation.</p>

<p>"I'm startin' early," she explained. "I told the
hotel man soon's I come in to have me called at
five o'clock. So I'll say good-by now. An' thank
ye both fer all yer kindness," she ended, primly.</p>

<p>Dr. Harland laughed. Then, impulsively, she
took both the woman's toil-hardened hands in hers.</p>

<p>"Good-by, then, and God bless you," she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
"My cure has worked. I'll comfort myself with
that knowledge."</p>

<p>For a moment the eyes of Tildy Mears fell.</p>

<p>"You ben mighty good," she said. "You both
ben good. Don't think I ain't grateful." She hesitated,
then went on in halting explanation. "'S
long's you ain't married," she said, "an' ain't got
nothin' else to do, it's fine to travel round an' talk
to folks. But someway sence I see that man to-night,
settin' there lookin' like Jim, I realize things is different
with us married women."</p>

<p>She drew her small figure erect, her voice taking
on an odd suggestion of its ringing platform note.</p>

<p>"Talkin' is one thing," she said, tersely, "livin'
is another thing. P'rhaps you ain't never thought
of that. But I see the truth now, an' I see it clear."</p>

<p>Her peroration filled the little room, and like a
swelling organ tone rolled through the open door
and down the stairs, where it reached the far recesses
of the hall below. Her lean right arm shot
upward in her one characteristic gesture, as if she
called on high Heaven itself to bear witness to the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
The Authors' Dinner had reached that peak
of success which rises serenely between the
serving of the dessert and the opening words of the
first postprandial speech. Relaxed, content, at peace
with themselves and their publisher-host, the great
assemblage of men and women writers sipped their
coffee and liqueurs, and beamed benignly upon one
another as they waited for the further entertainment
the speeches were expected to afford. Here
and there, at the numerous small tables which flowered
in the great dining-room, a distinguished author,
strangely modest for the moment, stealthily
consulted some penciled notes tucked under his napkin,
or with absent eyes on space mentally rehearsed
the opening sentences of his address. Even the
least of these men was accustomed to public speaking;
but what they had said to Chautauqua gatherings
or tossed off casually at school commencements
in their home towns was not quite what they would
care to offer to an audience which included three
hundred men and women representing every stage
of literary success, and gifted, beyond doubt, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
a highly developed sense of humor. A close observer
could discover the speakers of the evening by running
an eye over the brilliantly decorated tables
and selecting those faces which alone in that care-free
assemblage wore expressions of nervous apprehension.</p>

<p>At my table, well toward the center of the room,
I felt again a thrill of delight at being a part of this
unique composite picture. My first book, still an
infant in the literary cradle, had won me my invitation;
and nothing except the actual handling of
the volume, hot from the press, had given me so
strong a sense of having at last made a beginning in
the work I loved. Save myself, every man and
woman of the eight at our table stood on the brow
of the long hill each had climbed. Three of them&mdash;a
woman playwright, a man novelist, and a famous
diplomat&mdash;were among my close friends. The others
I had met to-night for the first time. The Playwright
sat opposite me, and over the tall vase of
Spanish iris which stood between us I caught the
expression of her brown eyes, thoughtful and introspective.
For the moment at least she was very
far away from the little group around her. Beside
her sat the Author, his white locks caressing a suddenly
troubled brow. He was one of the speakers
of the evening, and he had just confided to his companions
that he had already forgotten his carefully
prepared extemporaneous address. At my right
the grand old man of American diplomacy smiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
in calm content. He rarely graced such festive
scenes as this; he was over ninety, and, he admitted
cheerfully, "growing a little tired." But his Reminiscences,
recently published, was among the most
widely read literature of the day, and the mind
which had won him distinction fifty years ago was
still as brilliant as during his days at foreign courts.</p>

<p>Over our group a sudden stillness had fallen, and
with an obvious effort to break this, one of my new
acquaintances addressed me, her cold blue eyes reflecting
none of the sudden warmth of her manner.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Iverson," she began, "I
envy you. You have had five years of New York
newspaper experience&mdash;the best of all possible training.
Besides, you must have accumulated more
material in those five years than the average writer
finds in twenty."</p>

<p>I had no opportunity to reply. As if the remark
had been a gauntlet tossed on the table in challenge,
my companions fell upon it. Every one talked
at once, the Best Seller and the Author upholding
the opinion of the woman with the blue eyes, the
rest disputing it, until the Playwright checked the
discussion with a remark that caught the attention
of all.</p>

<p>"There's nothing new in this world," she said,
"and therefore there's nothing interesting. We all
know too much. The only interesting things are
those we can't understand, because they happen&mdash;elsewhere."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>The Author looked at her and smiled, his white
eyebrows moving upward ever so slightly. "For
example?" he murmured.</p>

<p>Almost imperceptibly the Playwright shrugged
her shoulders.</p>

<p>"For example?" she repeated, lightly. "Oh, I
wasn't contemplating an example. Not that I
couldn't give one if I chose." She stopped. Then,
stirred by the skeptical look in the Author's eyes,
her face took on a sudden look of decision. "And
I might," she added, quietly, "if urged."</p>

<p>The Best Seller leaned across the table and laid
a small coin on her plate. "I'll urge you," he said.
"I'll take a story. We want the thing in fiction
form."</p>

<p>The Playwright smiled at him. "Very well,"
she said, indifferently; "call it what you please&mdash;an
instance, a story."</p>

<p>"And mind," interrupted the Best Seller, "it's
something that didn't happen on this earth."</p>

<p>The Playwright sat silent an instant, intent and
thoughtful, as if mentally marshaling her characters
before her. "Part of it happened on this
earth," she said. "It began two years ago, when
a friend of mine, a woman editor, received a letter
from a stranger, who was also a woman. The
stranger asked for a personal interview. She wished,
she said, for the editor's advice. The need had suddenly
come to her to make her living. She had had
no special training; would the editor talk to her and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
give her any suggestions she could? The editor
consented, naming a day and an hour for the interview,
and at the time appointed the stranger called
at the other's office.</p>

<p>"She proved to be a beautiful woman, a little
over forty, dressed quietly but exquisitely in black,
and with the walk and manner of an empress. The
editor was immensely impressed by her, but she
soon discovered that the stranger was wrapped in
mystery. She could learn nothing about her past,
her friends, or herself. She was merely a human
package dropped from space and labeled 'Miss Driscoll'&mdash;the
name engraved on her card. Who 'Miss
Driscoll' was, where she had come from, what she
had done, remained as much of a problem after half
an hour of conversation as at the moment she had
entered the editor's room. She wanted work; how
could she get it? That was her question, but she
had no answers for any questions asked by the
editor. When they were put to her she hedged and
fenced with exquisite skill. She had a charming air
of intimacy, of confidence in the editor's judgment,
yet nothing came from her that threw any light on
her experience or her qualifications.</p>

<p>"All the time they talked the editor studied her.
Then suddenly, without warning, she leaned forward
and shot out the question that had been slowly
forming in her mind.</p>

<p>"'When did you leave your Order?' she asked.</p>

<p>"The stranger stiffened like one who had received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
an electric shock. The next moment she sagged
forward in her chair as if something in her had given
way. 'How did you know?' she breathed, at last.</p>

<p>"The editor shook her head. 'I did not know,'
she admitted. 'I merely suspected. You have one
or two habits which suggest a nun, especially the
trick of crossing your hands as if you expected to
slip them into flowing sleeves. They look like a
nun's hands, too; and your complexion has the
convent pallor. Now tell me all you can. I cannot
help you until I know more about you.'"</p>

<p>Around us there was the scrape of chairs on the
polished floor. Some of the dinner-guests were rising
and crossing the room to chat with friends at
other tables. But the little group at our table sat
in motionless attention, every eye on the Playwright's
charming face.</p>

<p>"Good beginning," remarked the Best Seller, helpfully.
"And, by Jove, the orchestra is giving you
the 'Rosary' as an obbligato. There's a coincidence
for you."</p>

<p>"Then the story came out," resumed the Playwright,
ignoring the interruption. "At least part
of it came out. The stranger had been the Mother
General of a large conventual Order, which she herself
had founded twenty years ago. She had built
it up from one convent to thirty. She had established
schools and hospitals all over America, as well as
in Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines. She was
a brilliant organizer, a human dynamo. Whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
she touched succeeded. She did not need to explain
this; the extraordinary growth of her Community
spoke for her. But a few months before she came
to the editor, she said, a cabal had been established
against her in her Mother House. She had returned
from a visit to one of her Philippine convents to find
that an election had been held in her absence, that
she had been superseded, that the local superior of
the Mother House had been elected Mother General
in her place; in short, that she herself was deposed
by her Community.</p>

<p>"She said that she never knew why. There was
much talk of extravagance, of too rapid growth;
her broadening plans, and the big financial risks
she took, alarmed the more conservative nuns. She
took their breath away. Possibly they were tired
of the pace she set, and ready to rest on the Community's
achievements. All that is not important.
Mother General Elise was deposed. She could not
remain as a subordinate in the Community she had
ruled so long. Neither could she, she said, risk destroying
the work of her life by making a fight for
her rights and causing a newspaper sensation. So
she left the Order, taking with her her only living
relative, her old mother, eighty-one years of age,
to whom for the previous year or two she had given
a home in her Mother House."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," murmured the Best Seller, sadly,
"that this story is going to depress me."</p>

<p>The Playwright nodded. "At first," she admitted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
"But it ends with what we will call 'an
uplift.'"</p>

<p>The Best Seller emptied his glass. "Oh, all right,"
he murmured. "Here's to the uplift!"</p>

<p>"The editor listened to the story," continued the
Playwright. "Then she advised Miss Driscoll to
go to Rome and have her case taken up at the Vatican.
Surely what seemed such injustice would be
righted there, and without undesirable notoriety
for the Community. She introduced the former
Mother General to several prominent New York
men and women who could help her and give her
letters she needed. There were various meetings at
the houses of these people, who were all impressed
by the force, the magnetism, and the charm of the
convent queen who had been exiled from her kingdom.
Then Miss Driscoll and her mother sailed
for Italy."</p>

<p>The Diplomat leaned forward, his faded eyes as
eager as a boy's. "Let me tell some of it!" he
begged. "Let me tell what happened in Rome!"</p>

<p>The blue-eyed woman who had started the discussion
clapped her hands. "Let each of us tell
some of it," she cried. The Playwright smiled
across at the Diplomat. "By all means," she urged,
"tell the Roman end of it."</p>

<p>The Diplomat laid down his half-finished cigar,
and put his elbows on the table, joining his finger-tips
in the pose characteristic of his most thoughtful
moments. He, too, took a moment for preparation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and the faces of the others at the table showed that
they were already considering the twist they would
give to the story when their opportunity came.</p>

<p>"The mother and daughter reached Rome in
May," began the Diplomat. "They rented a few
rooms and bought a few pieces of furniture, and,
because they were very poor, they lived very frugally.
While the daughter sought recognition at the
Vatican the old mother spent her days pottering
around their little garden and trying to learn a few
words of Italian from her neighbors. It was hard
to be transplanted at eighty-one, but she was happy,
for she was with the daughter she had always adored.
She would rather have been alone with her in a
strange land than in the highest heaven without her.</p>

<p>"One of the Cardinals at the Vatican finally took
up the case of Miss Driscoll. It interested him. He
knew of the splendid work she had done as Mother
General Elise. He began an investigation of the
whole involved affair, and he had accumulated a
great mass of documents, and was almost ready to
submit a formal report to the Holy Father, when
he fell ill with pneumonia and died a few days later.</p>

<p>"That was a crushing blow for Mother Elise.
Under the shock of the disappointment she, too, fell
ill, and was taken to what we will call the Hospital of
the White Sisters. Her mother went with her, because
an old lady of eighty-two could not be left alone."</p>

<p>The old Diplomat paused and looked unseeingly
before him, as if he were calling up a picture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>"The convent hospital had a beautiful garden,"
the Diplomat resumed, at last. "There the mother
spent the next few days working among the flowers
and following the lay Sisters along the garden walks
as a contented child follows its nurse. Once a day
she was allowed to see her daughter for a few moments.
It was her custom to reach the sick-room
long before the hour appointed and to wait in the
hall until she was admitted. She said the time of
waiting seemed shorter there, where she was so near.
So one day, when a pale Sister told her that her
daughter was not quite ready to be seen, the old
lady was not surprised. This was her usual experience.</p>

<p>"Nothing warned her, no intuition told her, that
her daughter had died exactly five minutes before
and that the Sisters back of that closed door were
huddled together, trying to find words to tell her
what had happened. They could not find them;
words scamper away like frightened beings in moments
like that. So they sent for their Mother
Superior, and she came and put an arm around the
bent shoulders of the old woman and told her that
her daughter's pain and trouble were over for all
time. Later they took her into the room where her
daughter lay in a peace which remained triumphant
even while the mother's heart broke as she looked
upon it. When they found that they could not persuade
her to leave the room they allowed her to remain;
and there she sat at the foot of the bed day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and night, while the Sisters came and went and knelt
and prayed, and the long wax tapers at the head
and feet of the dead nun burned slowly down to their
sockets."</p>

<p>The Diplomat stopped. Then, as no one spoke,
he turned to the Author.</p>

<p>"Will you go on?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Author took up the tale. "Mother Elise was
buried in Rome," he said, "and in the chapel of the
White Sisters tapers still burn for her. Her mother
remained there, and was given a home in the convent,
because she had no other place to go. It was kind of
the Sisters, for, unlike her daughter, she was not a
Catholic. But her old heart was broken, and as
months passed and she began to realize what had
happened she was filled with a great longing for her
native land. The bells of Rome got on her shattered
nerves. They seemed eternally ringing for
her dead. From the garden she could see her daughter's
grave on the hill just beyond the convent walls.
She longed for the only thing she had left&mdash;her own
country. She longed to hear her native tongue.
She said so to all who would listen. One day she
received an anonymous letter, inclosing bank-notes
for five thousand lira. The letter read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I hear that you are homesick. Take this money and return
to your native land. It will pay your passage and secure
your admission to a home for aged gentlewomen. Do not try
to discover the source of the gift.</p>

<p class="left45">
"<span class="smcap">From One Who Loved Your Daughter.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"A little blossom of comfort bloomed in the old
woman's heart, like an edelweiss on a glacier. She
packed her few possessions and sailed for America.
There was no one to meet her, but she had kept the
name and address of the woman editor; she was
sure the editor would advise her about getting into
the right home. In the mean time she went from the
steamer to a cheap New York lodging-house, of
which some fellow passenger had told her, and from
there she sent a hurried summons to the editor. She
was already panic-stricken in this big country, which
held the graves of all she loved but one. It suddenly
seemed to her as strange, as terrible as Italy. She
was afraid of everything&mdash;afraid of the people she
met, of the sounds she heard, of the prying lodging-house
keeper and her red-eyed husband. Most of
all, she was afraid of these two, and she had reason
to be.</p>

<p>"The editor had not even known the old lady was
coming to this country, but she responded to the
call the night she received it, for she could tell that
the writer was frantic with fear. She climbed three
flights of rickety stairs and found the old woman
in a state of unreasoning terror, like a lost child in
the dark. Already the keepers of the lodging-house
had tried to get her money from her; she was hungry,
for they did not furnish meals, and she had been
afraid to go out for food. The editor took her away
from the place that night and home to her own
apartment. There she had a long talk with her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"'Now, Mrs. Driscoll,' she said, 'I want you to
forget your troubles if you can and settle down here
and be at peace. Leave the matter of the home to
me. I will find the right place, and when I have found
it I will tell you about it and take you to see it. Then,
if you approve, in you go. We will put your money
in the bank to-morrow and leave it there until the
matter of the home is settled. In the mean time
don't think or talk about the future. It may take
some time to find the right home. I'm not going
to run to you with every hope or disappointment
that my investigation brings. Forget about it yourself,
but don't think I have forgotten because I am
not keeping you stirred up with daily or weekly
reports.'</p>

<p>"The old lady settled down like a contented child
in its mother's lap. As the weeks passed her eyes
lost their look of panic and took on the serenity of
age. Her thin figure filled out. She transferred to
her only friend something of the devotion she had
given her daughter. She was almost happy.</p>

<p>"In the mean time the editor began her investigations,
and she at once discovered that it is not
easy to find a home for an aged and indigent gentlewoman.
All the institutions to which she applied
were filled, and each had waiting-lists that looked,
she said, 'yards long.' The secretaries were courteous.
They almost invariably sent her lists of other
institutions, and she wrote to these, or visited them
if they were within reach; and the weeks and months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
crawled by, and the city grew hot and stifling. She
was worn out by the quest to which she was giving
every hour of her spare time, but she was no nearer
success than she had been the first day. She had
arranged to go to Europe for a rest which she sadly
needed, and the date of her sailing was very near.
But she could not go and leave her protégée unprovided
for, nor could she leave her alone with a servant.
Her search became a very serious thing; it
kept her awake nights; it got on her nerves; it became
an obsession which, waking or sleeping, she
could not forget. She began to go down under it,
but no one knew that, for she kept it to herself; and
the least suspicious person of all her friends was the
old lady, who each evening listened for her footstep
as one listens for that of the best beloved,
coming home."</p>

<p>The Author stopped.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said the Best Seller, "it <i>is</i> a depressing
yarn. Let me see if I can't brighten it up a bit."</p>

<p>But the Author glanced at me. "Forgive me,
old man," he said to the Best Seller, who was a friend
of his. "I know what you would do. You would
certainly brighten it up. You would discover a
long-lost son, throw in Thanksgiving at the old
home, and wind up with the tango. I think Miss
Iverson ought to go on with the story."</p>

<p>He and the Playwright smiled at me. I felt
neither nervous nor self-conscious as I took up the
story, but the Best Seller openly grumbled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>"I could put some snap in that," he exclaimed.
"But go on, Miss Iverson. Only I call this a close
corporation."</p>

<p>"There came," I began, "a very hot day. The
editor had heard of a home beyond the city limits,
where the view was beautiful and the air was pure.
She went to see it. The date was the twenty-second
of July, and the day was the hottest of the season.
At the end of the trolley-line there was a broiling
walk in the sun. The editor dragged her weary feet
along the dusty road, her eyes on the great brick
building she was approaching. Before it a cool
lawn sloped down to a protecting hedge. She could
see old ladies sitting on benches under trees, and a
big lump came into her throat as she thought of her
protégée and wondered if at last she had found her
a permanent resting-place, if this haven was for her.
In the dim reception-room she waited hopefully,
but almost the first words of the Sister who finally
appeared showed that nothing could be expected
from her.</p>

<p>"She was merely repeating all the phrases the
editor knew by heart. The place was 'full to overflowing.'
There were 'almost two hundred on the
waiting-list.' But, of course, there were other places.
She rattled off an impressive list. Every home on
it was one the editor had already visited or heard
from; there was no room, she knew, in any of them.
At her side the Sister uttered sympathetic murmurs.
It was, she said, very sad. Then briskly she arose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
She was a busy woman, and she had already given
this caller more time than she could well spare.
Perhaps the look on the editor's face checked her
steps. Uncertainly for a second she hesitated at
the threshold. She could do nothing, but&mdash;yes,
there was still the impulse of hospitality.</p>

<p>"'Would you like to see our new chapel?' she
asked, kindly. 'It is just finished, and we are very
proud of it.'</p>

<p>"The editor did not really care to see the new
chapel. In her depression she would not have cared
to see anything. But she was very warm, very
tired, utterly discouraged. She wanted a few quiet
moments in which to pull herself together, to rest,
to think, and to plan. The new chapel would give
her these. She followed the Sister to its dim shelter,
and, crossing its threshold, knelt in a pew near
the door. Sister Italia, kneeling beside her, suddenly
leaned toward her and whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>"'Remember,' she smiled, 'when you pray in a
new chapel three prayers are surely answered.'</p>

<p>"The editor returned her smile. Already she was
feeling better. The chapel was really beautiful, and
its atmosphere was infinitely soothing. Before the
altar gleamed one soft light, like a distant star, and
like larger stars the rose windows at the right and
left seemed to pulse with color. Here and there a
black-veiled nun knelt motionless with bowed head.
The editor offered two of her prayers: that she
might soon find a home for Mrs. Driscoll; that Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Driscoll might be happy and content in the home
when she had found it. Then, her eyes still on the
distant altar light, her thoughts turned to Mother
Elise&mdash;at rest in her Roman grave. Here, surely,
was a fit setting for thought of her&mdash;a convent
chapel such as those in which she had spent years
of her life. How many vigils she must have had in
such a place, how many lonely hours of fasting and
of prayer!</p>

<p>"'I wish,' the editor reflected, dreamily, 'I wish
I could feel that she is with me in this search for the
home. Of course she is&mdash;if she knows. I'm sure of
that. But <i>does</i> she know? Or is she in some place
so inconceivably remote that even the tears and
prayers of her helpless old mother have never reached
her? I wish I could know that she is watching&mdash;that
she won't let me make a mistake.'</p>

<p>"She sighed. Close to her Sister Italia stirred,
then rose from her knees and led the way from the
chapel. The editor followed. At the outer door
of the main building Sister Italia asked a question.</p>

<p>"'Did you offer your three prayers?' she wanted
to know.</p>

<p>"The editor reflected. 'I offered two,' she said,
slowly. Then a sudden memory came to her, and
she smiled. 'Why, yes,' she said, 'I offered all three,
without realizing it.'"</p>

<p>The Best Seller interrupted. He was an irrepressible
person. "It's still too somber," he said.
"But I see now how it can be lightened a bit. Take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
your cue from the musicians. They're playing the
Maxixe."</p>

<p>"Hush!" begged the woman with the blue eyes.
She turned them on me. There was an odd mist
over their cold brilliance. "Please go on, Miss Iverson,"
she said, gently.</p>

<p>I glanced at the Best Seller. "I'll lighten it a
bit," I promised.</p>

<p>The face of the Best Seller brightened. "Good
for you!" he exclaimed, elegantly.</p>

<p>"The editor went home," I resumed. "She was
very tired and still very much discouraged. The
long, hot ride had dispelled the memory of her moments
of peace. As she put her key in the lock of
her door the old mother heard the sound and came
trotting down the hall to meet her. She always did
that, and usually she had a dozen questions to ask.
Was the editor tired? Had she had a hard day?
Had it been very hot in her office? But to-night
she asked none of these. She came straight to the
editor and laid her hands on the other's shoulders;
her face held an odd look, apologetic, almost
frightened.</p>

<p>"'Oh, my dear,' she quavered. 'I have a confession
to make to you. I have been false to a sacred
trust.'</p>

<p>"The editor laughed and led her back into the
living-room, where she seated her in a big chair by
an open window. She did not believe the old lady
had ever been false to any trust, and she was very

anxious to get out of her working-clothes and into
cool garments.</p>

<p>"'I suppose it's something simply appalling,' she
said. 'Let me fortify myself for it with a bath and
a glass of lemonade. Then I'll listen to it.'</p>

<p>"But the old lady shook her head. 'No, no,'
she gulped. 'I've waited too long already. I <i>must</i>
do it now. Oh, listen; <i>please</i> listen!'</p>

<p>"The editor humored her. The old lady was not
often unreasonable, and it was clear that she was
desperately in earnest. The editor sat down and
rested her tired head against the back of her chair
while she drew off her gloves.</p>

<p>"'Very well,' she said, 'I'm listening.'</p>

<p>"The old lady began at once. Her words came
out with an indescribable effect of breathlessness,
as if she could not make her explanation soon enough.
She leaned forward, her faded eyes, with their old
frightened look, fastened on the editor's face.</p>

<p>"'The day before my daughter died,' she began,
almost in a whisper, 'she and I had our last talk.
She seemed better. Neither of us thought she was
very ill. But she said it was wise when she felt
well to discuss a few things. She told me how little
money we had and where it was, and she said the
Mother Superior had promised to let me stay in
the convent if ever I needed a home. Then she took
off her ring, the Community ring she had always
worn as the symbol of her office, and handed it to
me. 'If I go before you,' she ended, 'I want you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
to send this ring to our friend in New York&mdash;our
friend the editor.'</p>

<p>"The old woman stopped. In her hand she held
something with which her fingers fumbled. Her
head drooped.</p>

<p>"'I forgot it,' she confessed, in a whisper the editor
strained her ears to catch. 'When she died so suddenly
the next day I forgot everything except her
going. When I remembered a few months later I
did not know how to send the ring to you, so I
waited. And when I came to New York those first
horrible days in the lodging-house sent everything
else out of my mind.' Her head drooped lower.
'You'll forgive me,' she ended.</p>

<p>"She rose and came toward the editor, and the
editor rose to face her.</p>

<p>"'Why, my dear,' she began, 'you mustn't give
it a second thought. Why should you worry about
it?'</p>

<p>"But the old lady interrupted her and went on,
as if she had been checked in a recital which she
must finish without a break. 'Wait,' she said. 'To-day,
this afternoon, I remembered it! The memory
came to me with a kind of shock. I thought, "I
have never given her the ring." It brought me out
of my chair. I started to get the ring at once, but
I could not remember where it was. I stood still,
trying to think. Then suddenly that came to me,
too. It was down in the corner of my biggest trunk,
the one I had not unpacked, the one that holds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
all my winter things. So I unpacked it&mdash;and here
is the ring.'</p>

<p>"She held it out. It was a heavy gold band with
a raised Latin inscription on its outer surface. The
editor took it in her hand, but her mind held only
one idea.</p>

<p>"'You unpacked that great trunk,' she gasped,
'this frightfully hot day? With all those furs and
flannels? Why, Mrs. Driscoll, how <i>could</i> you do
such a thing?'</p>

<p>"The old woman drew a deep breath. 'I had to,'
she muttered. Her eyebrows puckered. Plainly,
she was puzzled and a little afraid. 'I felt I had to,'
she repeated. 'It seemed,' she added, slowly, 'almost
like a message from my daughter!'</p>

<p>"The editor turned the ring in her hand and
looked at the Latin inscription, and as she did so she
saw again, not the face of the beautiful woman who
had come to her after her downfall, but the quiet
convent chapel in which she herself had knelt that
afternoon. A little chill ran the length of her spine.
For there were three words on the ring."</p>

<p>The Diplomat leaned forward. "That's interesting,"
he said. "I didn't know about the inscription.
The three words were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'<i>Adveniat Regnum Tuum</i>,'" said the editor.</p>

<p>"'Thy Kingdom Come,'" translated the Best Seller,
swiftly, proud of his Latin. "By Jove, the editor
got her message, didn't she? I like your ending, Miss
Iverson. But it doesn't prove the original point."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>The Playwright leaned across the table. "Doesn't
it?" she asked, gently. "Then show them the ring,
May."</p>

<p>I drew the heavy circle from my finger. In silence
it was passed from palm to palm. The glance of
the blue-eyed woman touched the face of the Playwright,
the Diplomat, and the Author and rested on
me. Then she drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"So it's true!" she said. "You four saw it work
out! Where is Mrs. Driscoll now?"</p>

<p>"In the Emerson Home for Gentlewomen," the
Diplomat told her. "The best, I think, in this
country. You ran out to see her last week, didn't
you, Bassinger?"</p>

<p>The Author admitted the charge. "She's very
happy there," he said.</p>

<p>At his table at the head of the room our host was
on his feet. "Ladies and gentlemen," he began&mdash;</p>

<p>But the Best Seller was whispering to me. "It
wasn't exactly telepathy," he said, "for no one but
the old lady knew anything about that ring. It
was just an odd coincidence that sent her burrowing
into furs and moth-balls that hot day. But you
can make a story of it, Miss Iverson&mdash;a good one,
too, if you'll work in a lot of drama and pathos."</p>

<span class="s08">"T. B." CONDUCTS A REHEARSAL</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
The stage director rose and rolled up his copy
of the play, pushing toward me with his disengaged
hand the half-dozen round white peppermints
which, arranged on a chalk-lined blue blotter,
had been chastely representing my most important
characters in their most vital scene. His smooth,
round face was pale with fatigue; the glow of his
brown eyes had been dimmed by sleepless nights;
he had the weary air of a patient man who has listened
to too much talk&mdash;but not for one moment
had he lost his control of the situation or of us.</p>

<p>"That might have made a better picture," he
conceded, graciously. "But we can't make any
more changes till after the dress rehearsal to-night;
and if that goes well we won't want to make any.
Don't you worry, Miss Iverson. We've got a winner!"</p>

<p>This, coming from Herbert Elman at the close of
our last official conference, was as merciful rain to
a parched field, but I was too weary to respond to
it, except by a tired smile. Under its stimulation,
however, our star, who had been drooping forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
in her chair surveying the peppermints much as
Lady Macbeth must have gazed upon the stain
on her hand, blossomed in eager acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"Bertie, you are a trump!" she exclaimed, gratefully.
"It's simply wonderful how you keep up
your enthusiasm after three weeks of work. It was
criminal of Miss Iverson and me to drag you here
this afternoon. I suppose we had lost our nerve,
but that doesn't excuse us."</p>

<p>Elman had started for the door on the cue of his
valedictory. At her words he turned and came back
to the desk where we sat together, his face stamped
with a sudden look of purpose; and upon my little
study, in which for the past three hours we had
wrangled over a dozen unimportant details, a hush
fell, as if now, at last, something had entered which
was real and vital. For an instant he stood before
us, looking down at us with eyes that held an unaccustomed
sternness. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"I had a few words to say to you two when I
came here," he began, "but you were both so edgy
that I changed my mind. However, if you're talking
about losing your nerve you need them, and
I'm going to get them off my chest."</p>

<p>Miss Merrick interrupted him, her blue eyes
widening like those of a hurt baby.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bertie," she begged, "p-please don't say
anything disagreeable. Here we've been rehearsing
for weeks, and we three still speak. We're <i>al-most</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
friendly. And now, at the eleventh hour, you're
going to spoil everything!"</p>

<p>Her words came out in a little wail. She dropped
her head in her hands with a gesture of utter fatigue.</p>

<p>"You are," she ended. "You know you are, and
I'm <i>so-o</i> tired!"</p>

<p>Elman laughed. No one ever took Stella Merrick
seriously, except during her hours on the stage when
she ceased to be Stella Merrick at all and entered
the soul of the character she was impersonating.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said, brusquely. "I'm going to
show my friendship by giving you a pointer, that's
all."</p>

<p>Miss Merrick drew a deep breath and twisted
the corner of her mouth toward me&mdash;a trick I had
learned from Nestor Hurd five years ago and had
unconsciously taught her in the past three weeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, if that's all!" she murmured, in obvious relief.</p>

<p>"You should have been in your beds the entire
day," continued Elman, severely, "both of you,
like the rest of the company. We'll rehearse all
night, and you know it; and I'll tell you right now,"
he added, pregnantly, "that you're going to be up
against it."</p>

<p>He waited a moment to give his words the benefit
of their cumulative effect, and then added, slowly:</p>

<p>"Just before I came here this afternoon T. B.
told me that to-night he intends to rehearse the company
himself."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>I heard Stella Merrick gasp. The little sound
seemed to come from a long distance, for the surprise
of Elman's announcement had made me dizzy.
"T. B." was our manager, better known as "The
Governor" and "The Master." He had more
friends, more enemies, more successes, more insight,
more failures, more blindness, more mannerisms,
more brutality, and more critics than any other
man in the theatrical world. His specialty was the
avoidance of details. He let others attend to these,
and then, strolling in casually at the eleventh hour,
frequently undid the labor to which they had given
weeks.</p>

<p>Though his money was producing my play, I had
met him only once; and this, I had been frequently
assured by the company, had been the one redeeming
feature of an unusually strenuous theatrical experience.
"T. B." never attended any but dress rehearsals,
leaving everything to his stage directors
until the black hours when he arrived to consider
the results they had accomplished. It was not an
infrequent thing for him on these occasions to disband
the company and drop the play; that he should
change part of the cast and most of the "business"
seemed almost inevitable. For days I had been
striving to accustom myself to the thought that
during our dress rehearsal "T. B." would be sitting
gloomily down in the orchestra, his eyes on the
back drop, his chin on his breast, a victim to that
profound depression which seized him when one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
his new companies was rehearsing one of his new
plays. At such times he was said to bear, at the best,
a look of utter desolation; at the worst, that of a
lost and suffering soul.</p>

<p>At long intervals, when Fate perversely chose to
give her screw the final turn for an unhappy playwright,
"T. B." himself conducted the last rehearsal,
and for several months after one of these tragedies
theatrical people meeting on Broadway took each
other into quiet corners and discussed what had
happened in awed whispers and with fearsome
glances behind them. It had not occurred to any
of us that "T. B." would be moved to conduct <i>our</i>
last rehearsal. This was his busiest season, and
Elman was his most trusted lieutenant. Now, however,
Elman's quiet voice was giving us the details
of "T. B.'s" intention, and as she listened Stella
Merrick's face, paling slowly under the touch of
rouge on the cheeks, took on something of the exaltation
of one who dies gloriously for a Cause. She
might not survive the experience, it seemed to say,
but surely even death under the critical observation
of "T. B." would take on some new dignity. If
she died in "T. B.'s" presence, "T. B." would see
that at least she did it "differently"!</p>

<p>"But, Bertie, that's <i>great</i>!" she exclaimed. "He
must have a lot of faith in the play. He must have
heard something. He hadn't any idea of conducting
when I spoke to him yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he had!" Elman's words fell on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
enthusiasm as frost falls on a tree in bloom. "He
didn't want to rattle you by saying so, that's all.
And he isn't doing this work to-night because he's
got faith in the play. It's more because he hasn't.
He hasn't faith in anything just now. Three of
his new plays have gone to the store-house this
month, and he's in a beastly humor. You'll have the
devil of a time with him."</p>

<p>Miss Merrick sprang to her feet and began to
pace the study with restless steps.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do?" she threw back
at him over her shoulder. "Take what little courage
we have left?"</p>

<p>Elman shook his dark head.</p>

<p>"I'm warning you," he said, quietly. "I want
you both to brace up. You'll need all the nerve
you've got, and then some, to get through what's
before us. He'll probably have an entirely new idea
of your part, Stella; and I don't doubt he'll want
Miss Iverson to rewrite most of her play. But
you'll both get through all right. You're not quitters,
you know."</p>

<p>His brown eyes, passing in turn from my face to
hers, warmed at what he saw in them. When he
began to speak we had been relaxed, depressed, almost
discouraged. Lack of sleep, nervous strain,
endless rehearsals had broken down our confidence
and sapped our energy; but now, in the sudden
lift of Stella Merrick's head, the quick straightening
of her shoulders, I caught a reflection of the change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
that was taking place in me. At the first prospect
of battle we were both as ready for action as Highland
regiments when the bagpipes begin to snarl.
Looking at us, Elman's pale face lit up with one of
his rare and brilliant smiles.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said, heartily. "A word to
the wise. And now I'm really off."</p>

<p>Almost before the door had closed behind him
Miss Merrick had seized her hat and was driving
her hat-pins through it with quick, determined
fingers.</p>

<p>"I'm going home and to bed," she said. "We
can both get in three hours' sleep before the rehearsal&mdash;and
believe me, Miss Iverson, we'll need
it! Do you remember what General Sherman said
about war? He should have saved his words for a
description of 'T. B.'"</p>

<p>I followed her out into the hall and to the elevator
door. I felt oddly exhilarated, almost as if I had
been given some powerfully stimulating drug.</p>

<p>"He doesn't exactly kill, burn, or pillage, does
he?" I asked, gaily.</p>

<p>With one foot in the elevator, our star stopped a
second and looked back at me. There was a world
of meaning in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"If he did nothing but that, my lamb!" she
breathed, and dropped from sight.</p>

<p>I returned to my desk. I had no idea of going to
bed. I was no Napoleon, to slumber soundly on the
eve of a decisive battle, but there was nothing else
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
I could do except to sweep the peppermint drops
out of sight and tuck the diagrammed blotter behind
a radiator. While I was engaged in these homely
tasks the bell of my telephone rang.</p>

<p>"Hello, Miss Iverson," I heard when I took down
the receiver. "Are you going to be at home to-night?"</p>

<p>My heart leaped at the familiar greeting of Billy
Gibson, star reporter of the <i>Searchlight</i>, and one
of my stanch friends ever since the days, five long
years ago, when he had given me my first lesson
in practical reporting. Almost before I could reply
to him I noticed something unnatural in the quality
of his voice. It was a little too easy, too casual,
too carefully controlled.</p>

<p>"Heard any late news about Morris?" asked Gibson.</p>

<p>"News?" I echoed. "What news? What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, then you don't know."</p>

<p>Gibson's voice was still ostentatiously cheerful,
but it dropped a little on his next words.</p>

<p>"Why, he's sick," he said. "Pretty sick. Has
pneumonia."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," I said, slowly. It had been
difficult to bring out the words. It was for some
reason impossible to say more, but Gibson went
on without waiting, thus giving me time to think.</p>

<p>"Haven't lost all interest in us, have you, now
that you've been away from us a year and are writing
plays?" he asked, cheerfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Billy, what about him?" At last I was
able to bring out the words. "Is it serious?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No one at the office realized it was until to-day,"
said Gibson. "This morning Colonel Cartwell
stopped at the Morris house on his way down-town
and happened to meet one of the consulting physicians.
Godfrey's pretty low," he added, gently.
"The crisis is expected to-night."</p>

<p>For what seemed a long time I sat staring blankly
at the telephone. Once or twice I tried to speak,
but no speech came. The forgotten receiver shook
in my hand. Every thought but one was wiped out
of my mind. Godfrey Morris was ill&mdash;very ill. He
had been ill for days&mdash;perhaps for weeks&mdash;and I
had not known it because I had been absorbed in
my petty interests, which until this moment had
seemed so big.</p>

<p>"If you care to have me," went on Gibson, hesitatingly,
"I'll telephone you later. I'm to be at
the Morris house most of the night and keep the
office posted from there. I can call you up once or
twice if&mdash;it won't disturb you."</p>

<p>I found my voice, but it sounded strange in my
own ears. For an instant I had seen myself sitting
in my study the long night through, getting messages
from the sick-room, but now I remembered my
work and the others who were concerned in it.</p>

<p>"Billy," I said, "we're having the dress rehearsal
of my play to-night. I may have to be at the Berwyck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Theater until three or four in the morning.
Can you send me word there&mdash;several times?"</p>

<p>Gibson's answer was prompt.</p>

<p>"You bet I can," he said. "I'll bring it. The
Morris house is only a few blocks from the Berwyck,
and I'll be glad of something to do besides receiving
and sending bulletins. Tell your door-man to let
me pass, and I'll drop in two or three times during
the night." His voice changed. "I thought," he
added, almost diffidently, "you'd want to know."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, slowly, "I want to know. Thank
you."</p>

<p>I hung up the receiver, which slipped in my stiff
fingers. The exhilaration of a few minutes before
lay dead within me. I felt cold and numb. From
the living-room off my study the light of my open
fire winked at me as if in cheery reassurance. I
crossed the room and crouched down before it,
stretching out shaking hands to the blaze. I seemed
to be moving in a nightmare, but with every sense
horribly acute. I remembered previous dreams in
which I had seemed to see, as I saw now, the familiar
objects of my home around me. I heard the beating
of my heart, the hammering of the blood in my head,
the sound of the quick breath I drew&mdash;almost the
murmur of Godfrey's voice as he babbled in delirium
in his distant sick-room.</p>

<p>"<i>The crisis is expected to-night.</i>" Gibson's words
came back to me. What was it we had arranged?
Oh yes&mdash;that he was to drop into the Berwyck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
several times and give me the latest bulletins. But
that would be hours from now, and suddenly I
realized that I could not wait. With a rush I was
back at the telephone asking for the Morris home.
I had neglected Grace Morris during the past few
months, as I had neglected all my other friends in
the work which had absorbed me. I dared not ask
for her now, when the English accents of the Morris
butler met my ear.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Crumley?" I asked. "This is Miss
Iverson. I've just heard that Mr. Morris is very
ill. Can you tell me how he is?"</p>

<p>Crumley's reply showed the impassiveness of the
well-trained servant.</p>

<p>"He's very low, Miss," he replied, evenly. "Very
low indeed. Two of the doctors are here now. They
don't hope for any change till toward morning."</p>

<p>I found words for one more question.</p>

<p>"Is he suffering?" I asked, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Suffering, Miss?" echoed Crumley. "No, Miss, I
think not. He's very quiet indeed&mdash;in a stupor-like."</p>

<p>I hung up the receiver with a steadier hand and sat
down, staring straight before me. As I had rallied
to Elman's words half an hour ago, so now I tried
to meet this new demand upon me. There was
nothing I could do for Godfrey; but a few hours
later there might be much to do for the manager
and the company who were giving my work to the
public. I must stand by them and it&mdash;that was the
one clear fact in a reeling world. I must be very cool,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
very clear-headed, very alert. I must have, Elman
had told me, all my nerve, "and then some." All
this, as I repeated it to myself, was quite plain, yet
it meant nothing vital to me. It was as if one side
of me had lashed with these reminders of duty another
side which remained unmoved. The only
thing of which I was vividly conscious was a scene
which I suddenly visualized&mdash;a sick-room, large
and cool and dim, a silent figure in a big bed, doctors
and nurses bending over it. At the foot of the bed
sat a figure I recognized, Godfrey's mother. Of
course she would be there. I saw the gleam of her
white hair, the look in the gray eyes which were so
like her son's.</p>

<p>"<i>The crisis is expected to-night.</i>" The old clock in my
hall seemed to be ticking off the words, over and over.
The hammering blood in my brain was making them
into a refrain which I found myself dully repeating.</p>

<p>With a start I pulled myself together. I was on
my feet again, walking back and forth, back and
forth, across my study. It was growing late. Through
my dark windows the lights of surrounding buildings
glowed in at me like evil eyes. I must get
ready for my work. Resolutely I held my thoughts
to that point for an instant, then they swung away.
"<i>The crisis is expected to-night. The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.
Time&mdash;to&mdash;get&mdash;to&mdash;work. The crisis
is expected to-night.</i>"</p>

<p>I found that I was dressing. Well, let "T. B."
do his worst. He could tear me and my play to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
tatters, he could disband the company and disrupt
the universe, if only for a few blessed hours he could
keep me from seeing that shadowy room, that still,
helpless figure. But he couldn't. "<i>The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.
The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.</i>"
And when it came, while the great battle
was waged that I now knew meant life to me, too,
I would be in an up-town theater, listening to petty
human beings recite the petty lines of a petty play,
to which in my incredible blindness I had given my
time for months, shutting myself away from my
friends, shutting myself away from Godfrey. How
many times had he telephoned and written? Half
a dozen at least. He had urged me to go to a concert
or two, to a play or two, but I had been "too
busy." It was monstrous, it was unbelievable, but
it was true. "<i>The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.</i>"</p>

<p>I was at the theater now. How I had reached it
was not quite clear. The members of the company
were there before me, scattered about in the wings
and on the big empty stage, lit by a single "bunch"
light. The information that "T. B." himself was
to conduct had fallen upon them like a pall. Under
its sable influence they whispered together in stricken
groups of three or four. Near the right first entrance
Elman and Miss Merrick sat, their heads close, the
star talking softly but rapidly, Elman listening
with his tired, courteous air. They nodded across
the stage at me when I appeared, but I did not join
them. Instead I slipped down into the dark auditorium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
and took my place in an orchestra seat, where
I could be alone. The whole thing was a nightmare,
of course. I could not possibly be sitting there
when only a few blocks away that sick-room held its
watching group, its silent, helpless patient. "<i>The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.</i>"</p>

<p>There was a sudden stir on the stage, a quick
straightening of every figure there, a business-like
bustle, and much scurrying to and fro. "T. B."
had entered the theater by the front door and was
striding down the middle aisle. I saw a huge bulk
that loomed grotesque for an instant as it leaned toward
the dark footlights for a word with Mr. Elman,
and dropped with a grunt into a chair in the third
row. Other figures&mdash;I did not know how many&mdash;had
entered the dark theater and taken their places
around me. From where I sat, half a dozen rows
behind him, I had a view of "T. B.'s" hair under
the slouch hat he kept on his head, the bulge of his
jaw as he turned his profile toward me, the sharp
upward angle of the huge cigar in his mouth. The
company were in their places in the wings and on
the stage. I heard Elman's quick word, "Curtain."
The rehearsal had begun. The familiar words of
the opening scene rolled over the footlights as cold
and vague as a fog that rolls in from the sea. "<i>The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.</i>"
No, that was not
what the office boy on the stage had just said. It
was what Gibson had said that afternoon, a thousand
years ago, when he had called me on the telephone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>Things were going badly up there on the stage.
Like a patient coming out of ether during an operation,
and vaguely conscious of what was passing
around her, I had moments of realizing this. Boyce
did not know his lines; he was garbling them frightfully,
and, by failing to give his associates their
cues, was adding to the panic into which "T. B.'s"
presence had already thrown them. There! He
had ruined Miss Merrick's opening scene, which
was flattening out, going to pieces. It seemed as
if some one should do something. Yet, what could
be done? "<i>The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.</i>"
What difference did it make what happened on
that stage? The conscious interval was over.
The babble that came over the footlights meant
nothing.</p>

<p>From his orchestra seat, into which he seemed to
be sinking deeper as the moments passed, "T. B."
sent forth a sardonic croak. It was a horrible noise&mdash;nerve-racking.
It reached down to where I was
submerged, caught me, drew me up to the surface
again. I saw the company cringe under it, heard
Elman's reprimand of Boyce, and his sharp command
to begin the scene again. Confusion, confusion,
so much confusion over such little things,
when only a few blocks away was that shadowy
sick-room in which the great battle between life
and death was being fought with hardly a sound.</p>

<p class="p2">It was midnight. "T. B." was conducting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
rehearsal. For three hours he had poured upon the
company the vitriol of his merciless tongue. For
three hours he had raced up and down the aisles
of the theater, alternately yelping commands and
taking flying leaps across the footlights to the stage
to go through a scene himself. He had laughed, he
had wept, he had pleaded, he had sworn, he had
cooed, he had roared. He had been strangely gentle
with the white-haired old man of the company, and
wholly brutal to a young girl who was doing
beautiful work. He had reduced every woman to
tears and every man to smothered and stuttering
profanity. And all the time, sitting in my seat in
the auditorium, I had watched him as dispassionately
and with almost as detached an interest as if he
were a manikin pulled by invisible wires and given
speech by some ventriloquist. It was all a bad
dream. He did not exist. We were not really there.
The things he said to the company swept by my
ears like the wail of a winter wind, leaving an occasional
chill behind them. The remarks he addressed
directly to me touched some cell of my
brain which mechanically but clearly responded. I
struck out lines and gave him new speeches, scrawling
them with a pencil on a pad upon my knee; I
"rebuilt" the curtain speech of the second act according
to his sudden notion and to his momentary
content; I transferred scenes and furnished new cues
while he waited for the copy with impatiently extended
hand. All the time the hush of the sick-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
lay around me; I saw the still figure in the
great four-poster bed.</p>

<p>I had never seen Godfrey Morris's bedroom,
though his sister had shown me his study. But now
it was clear in every detail&mdash;the polished, uncarpeted
floor, the carved pineapple tops of the four-poster,
the great windows, open at top and bottom, the
logs on the brass andirons in the grate, the brass-bound
wood-box near it, the soft glow of the night
lamps, the portrait of his mother which Sargent had
painted ten years ago and which Godfrey had hung
in his own room at the front of his bed. Yes, I remembered
now, he had told me about the portrait.
That was why I saw it so plainly, facing him as he
lay unconscious. He had told me about the four-poster,
too, and the high-boys in the room, and some
chests of drawers he had picked up. He was interested
in old mahogany. No, he was not interested
now in anything. He was "in a stupor-like,"
Crumley had said. "<i>The&mdash;crisis&mdash;is&mdash;expected&mdash;to-night.</i>"</p>

<p>"Great Scott, Miss Merrick!" shouted "T. B."
"Don't you realize that the woman would have
hysterics at this point? First she'd whimper, then
she'd cry, then she'd shriek and find she couldn't
stop. Like this&mdash;"</p>

<p>The theater filled with strange sounds&mdash;the wail
of a banshee, the yelps of a suffering dog, a series
of shrieks like the danger-blasts of a locomotive
whistle. Something in me lent an ear to them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
wondered what they meant. Surely they could not
mean that my heroine was to have an attack of
hysteria at that moment in my play. That was
all wrong&mdash;wholly outside of the character and the
scene; enough, indeed, to kill the comedy, to turn
it into farce.</p>

<p>"That's the idea," I heard "T. B." say. "Now
you try it. Here, we'll do it together."</p>

<p>Something flamed within me, instinctive, intense.
I half rose, then sank numbly back into my chair.
What did it matter? The only thing that disturbed
me was the noise. The uproar beat against my eardrums
in waves of sound that threatened to burst
them. My nightmare was growing worse. Was it
taking me to Bedlam? Was I shrieking, too? I
must not shriek in the big, quiet room where the
silent figure lay "in a stupor-like."</p>

<p>The chair beside me creaked. Gibson had dropped
into it. "T. B." and Miss Merrick were on the top
notes of their hysteria, but suddenly I ceased to hear
them. Every sense I had hung on the new-comer's
words. "No change," said Gibson, briefly. "None
expected till three or four o'clock. Thought I'd
drop in, anyway. Say"&mdash;a wraith of his wide and
boyish grin appeared&mdash;"what's going on? Is <i>this</i>
your rehearsal?"</p>

<p>The question meant nothing to me.</p>

<p>"Did you see any of the family?" I whispered.</p>

<p>Gibson nodded.</p>

<p>"Miss Morris came in for a minute at midnight,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
he told me, "while I was having supper. I opened
the door of Godfrey's room an inch, too, and saw
him through the crack."</p>

<p>"See here!" "T. B." was bellowing to a frightened
boy on the stage. "You're not giving an imitation
of Corbett entering the ring; you're supposed
to be a gentleman coming into a drawing-room.
See? Hook in your spine an' try it. And now
you're not havin' a hair-cut. You're greeting a
lady. And you're not makin' a face at her, either.
You're smiling at her. Smile, smile&mdash;my God, man,
smile! Try it. T-r-y-y it!"</p>

<p>His voice broke. He seemed about to burst into
tears. I caught Gibson's arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Billy," I gulped, "how did he look?"</p>

<p>Gibson patted my hand glancing away from me
as he answered.</p>

<p>"Very quiet," he said. "He's unconscious. The
nurse said he was 'resting comfortably.' That's
their pet formula, you know. Occasionally he mutters
something&mdash;a few disconnected words. By
Jove, what <i>is</i> that fellow doing now?"</p>

<p>I followed the direction of his eyes. "T. B." had
taken one of his flying leaps over the footlights,
assisted midway by a chair in the aisle which served
the purpose of a spring-board in this acrobatic feat.
Now he was at the right first entrance, swaggering
through the open door, his hands deep in his pockets,
every tooth in his head revealed in a fixed and
awful grin. Yet, strangely, through the swagger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
under the grin, one detected for an instant something
resembling a well-bred college boy entering
a drawing-room&mdash;something, too, of radiant youth,
irresponsible and charming.</p>

<p>"Jove," breathed Gibson, "he gets it, somehow,
doesn't he? One sees exactly what he's driving at."</p>

<p>But the little scene had faded as I looked at it,
like a negative dimming in the light. The door that
opened was the door of the sick-room, and the man
who had entered was one of the specialists who
watched over Godfrey to-night. I saw him approach
the bed and lean over the patient, looking at him
in silence for a moment, his finger on the pulse of
the thin hand that lay so still. Somewhere near a
woman was sobbing. Was it Mrs. Morris, or the
young girl in the wings? I did not know. "T. B.'s"
voice was cutting its way to me like the blast of a
steam siren through a fog.</p>

<p>"Miss Iverson," he yelled. "Cut out that kid's
love scene. He can't do it, and no one wants it
there, anyway. You've got some drama here now,
and, by Heaven, it's about time you had! Don't
throw it away. Keep to it." His voice broke on
the last words. Again he seemed to be on the verge
of tears. "<i>Keep&mdash;to&mdash;it</i>," he almost sobbed.</p>

<p>I carried my manuscript to a point in the wings
where, vaguely aided by one electric light hanging
far above me, I could make the changes for which
"T. B." had asked. They meant new cues for several
characters and a number of verbal alterations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
in their lines. Far down within me something
sighed over the loss of that love scene&mdash;sighed, and
then moaned over the loss of something else. "T. B.,"
his chin on his chest, his eyes on the floor, brooded
somberly in an orchestra seat until we were ready
to go over the revised scene. As I finished, Stella
Merrick leaned over me, her hand clutching my left
shoulder in a grip that hurt. Her teeth were chattering
with nervousness.</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> you be so calm?" she gasped. "I've
never seen him as devilish as he is to-night. If you
hadn't kept your nerve we'd all have gone to smash.
As it is, I have a temperature of a hundred and four!"</p>

<p>I wondered what Godfrey's temperature was.
Gibson had not told me. There must be a fever-chart
in the sick-room. It seemed almost as if I
could read it. Certainly I could see the jagged
peaks of it, the last point running off in a long wavering
line of weakness. Perhaps Gibson knew what
the temperature was. But when I returned to my
seat in the orchestra Gibson was no longer there.</p>

<p>"Open some of those windows," ordered "T. B.,"
irritably. "It's like a furnace in here."</p>

<p>Was that an ice-cap on Godfrey's head? Of
course. The nurse was changing it for a fresh one.
For a moment, the first in that endless night, I
seemed to see his face, waxen, the sensitive nostrils
pinched, the gray eyes open now and staring unseeingly
into space.</p>

<p>"No change," said Gibson's voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>Another period of time had dragged its way past
me like a sluggish snake.</p>

<p>"What o'clock?" I heard myself ask.</p>

<p>Gibson looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Quarter of two," he told me, snapping the case
shut. "I saw Dr. Weymarth just before I left."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>Gibson's eyes shifted from mine, which vainly
tried to hold them.</p>

<p>"No change," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Was that all?"</p>

<p>Gibson's eyes returned to mine for an instant
and shifted again.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I insisted.</p>

<p>"He's disappointed in the heart. It's been holding
its own, though the temperature has been terrific
from the first. But since midnight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, since midnight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not quite so strong."</p>

<p>Gibson's words came slowly, as if against his will.
There was a strange silence over the theater.
Through it the voice of "T. B." ripped its way
to us.</p>

<p>"Now we'll run through that scene again. And
if the author and the ladies and gentlemen of the
company will kindly remember that this is a rehearsal,
and not an afternoon tea, perhaps we'll get somewhere."</p>

<p>"Billy," I whispered, "I can't bear it."</p>

<p>"I know." Gibson patted my hand. "Sit tight,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
he murmured. "I'm off again. I'll be back in an
hour or so. By then they ought to know."</p>

<p>I watched him slip like a shadow through the dark
house, along the wall, and back toward the stage-door.
The voice of Stella Merrick was filling the
theater. I heard my name.</p>

<p>"Miss Iverson doesn't agree with me," she was
saying, "but I think that in this scene, when we
are reconciled and I say to my husband, 'My boy,'
he ought to answer, 'My mumsey!'"</p>

<p>"T. B.'s" reply sounded like a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>"What for?" he exploded. "Want to turn this
play into a farce?"</p>

<p>"Certainly <i>not</i>!"</p>

<p>"Then follow the lines."</p>

<p>It was the settlement for all time of an argument
which Miss Merrick and I had waged for weeks.
One scene at least, the final, vital scene, would be
spared to me. I felt a throb of gratitude, followed
by a sudden sick, indescribable sinking of the heart.
Had I for one instant forgotten? I remembered again.
Nothing mattered. Nothing would ever matter.</p>

<p>Some one sat down beside me, smiled at me, then
stared frankly. "Good Heaven, Miss Iverson, did
I frighten you?" cried Elman. "You look like a
ghost!"</p>

<p>Before I could answer, "T. B." approached us
both. Leaning over Elman, he nodded toward the
youth who was still vainly trying to act like a gentleman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>"Get rid of him."</p>

<p>"But we open in Atlantic City to-morrow night&mdash;"
began Elman.</p>

<p>"Get rid of him." "T. B.'s" tones permitted
no argument. "Get rid of Haskins, too, and of
Miss Arnold."</p>

<p>"But, great Scott, Governor&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elman's voice, usually so controlled, was almost
a wail. "T. B." strolled away. To "open" the next
night with three new members in the company
seemed impossible. Probably we wouldn't open at
all. By to-morrow night I would know. Godfrey
would be out of danger, or Godfrey would be&mdash;Why
didn't Gibson come? Elman murmured something
to me about "not taking it so hard," but I
caught only a few words. He said it could be done&mdash;that
he had the right people at hand. He would
see them the first thing in the morning, and go over
the lines with them and have them word-perfect
by night.</p>

<p>My eyes were strained in the direction of the stage-door.
My ears were awaiting the sound of Gibson's
quick footsteps. For now, I knew, in the sick-room,
where my mind and heart had been all night, the
crisis was near. Through the open windows the
blue-gray dawn was visible. The shaded lights were
taking on a spectral pallor. Nurse and doctors were
close to the bed, watching, listening for the change
that meant life or death.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;mighty good!" whispered Elman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>On the stage Miss Merrick and Peyton, the leading
man, were going through their final scene. The
familiar words, over which I had labored for months,
came to me as if out of a life I had lived on some
other planet ages back.</p>

<p>"You seem so far away," said the man. "I feel
as if I'd have to call across the world to make you
hear me. But I love you. Oh, Harriet, can't you
hear that?"</p>

<p>The voice of his wife, who was forgiving him and
taking him back, replied with the little break in
its beautiful notes which Stella Merrick always
gave to her answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; I guess I'd hear that anywhere."
And then, as she drew his head to her breast, "My
boy!"</p>

<p>Within me something alive, suffering and struggling,
cried out in sick revolt. What did these puppets
know about love? What had I known about
it when I wrote so arrogantly? But I knew now.
Oh yes, I knew now. Love and suspense and
agony&mdash;I knew them all.</p>

<p>On the dim stage the leading man and woman
melted into the embrace that accompanied the slow
fall of the curtain. In the wings, but well in view,
the members of the company clustered, watching
the final scene and wiping their wet eyes. They
invariably cried over that scene, partly because the
leading man and woman set the example, but more
because they were temperamental and tired. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
the brilliant eyes of Elman, who still sat beside me,
took on a sudden softness. He smiled at "T. B.,"
who had dropped into a seat near us.</p>

<p>"No change there, I guess," he hazarded.</p>

<p>"T. B." looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Quarter of four," he said, with surprise. Then
he yawned, and, rising, reached for his light overcoat
which lay on the back of a chair.</p>

<p>"That's all," he called, as he struggled into it.
"Boyce, study your lines to-morrow, or you're going
to have trouble. Peyton, you and Miss Mason better
go over that scene in the second act in the morning.
So-long, Miss Merrick."</p>

<p>He started to go, then stopped at my seat.</p>

<p>"Good night, Miss Iverson," he said, kindly.
"You've got the right nerve for this business. Of
course we can't make predictions, but I shouldn't
wonder if we're giving the public what they want
in this play."</p>

<p>He nodded and was gone. I had barely caught
his words. Over his big shoulders I saw Gibson approaching,
his face one wide, expansive grin. Never
before had anything seemed so beautiful to me as
that familiar Gibson smile. Never had I dreamed
I could be so rapturously happy in seeing it.</p>

<p>"Good news," he said, as soon as he came within
speaking-distance; and he added when he reached
me, "He's better. The doctors say they'll pull him
through."</p>

<p>At the first glimpse of him I had risen to my feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
with some vague impulse to take, standing, whatever
was coming. For a moment I stood quite still.
Then the thing of horror that had ridden me through
the night loosened its grip slowly, reluctantly, and
I drew a deep, deep breath. I wanted to throw myself
in Gibson's arms. I wanted to laugh, to cry,
to shout. But I did none of these things. I merely
stood and looked at him till he took my hand and
drew it through his arm.</p>

<p>"Rehearsal's over, I see," he said. "I'm going
to hunt up a taxi and take you home."</p>

<p>Together we went out into the gray morning
light, and I stood on the curb, full-lunged, ecstatic,
until Gibson and the taxi-cab appeared. He helped
me into the cab and took the seat beside me.</p>

<p>"You ought to go home," I murmured, with
sudden compunction. "You must be horribly
tired."</p>

<p>They were my first words. I had made no comment
on the message he brought, and it was clear
that he had expected none. Now he smiled at me&mdash;the
wide, kind, understanding smile that had
warmed the five years of our friendship.</p>

<p>"Let me do this much for you, May," he said.
"You see, it's all I can do."</p>

<p>Our eyes met, and suddenly I understood. An
irrepressible cry broke from me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Billy," I said. "Not <i>you</i>! Not <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "Just that. Just you and me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
But it's all right. I'd rather be your friend than
the husband of any other woman in the world."</p>

<p>The taxi-cab hummed on its way. The east reddened,
then sent up a flaming banner of light. I
should have been tired; I should have been hungry;
I should, perhaps, have been excited over "T. B.'s"
final words. I was none of those things. I was
merely in a state of supreme content. Nothing mattered
but the one thing in life which mattered supremely.
Godfrey was better; Godfrey would live!</p>

<h2>XII<br />

<span class="s08">THE RISE OF THE CURTAIN</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
On the desk in my study the bell of the telephone
sounded a faint warning, then rang
compellingly. It had been ringing thus at five-minute
intervals throughout the day, but there was
neither impatience nor weariness in the haste with
which I responded. I knew what was coming; it
was the same thing that had been coming since nine
o'clock that morning; and it was a pleasant sort
of thing, diverting to an exceedingly anxious mind.</p>

<p>"Hello, hello! Is that you, May? This is your
awe-struck friend, George Morgan. Josephine and
I want to inquire the condition of your temperature
and your pulse."</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Quite normal, thank you," I said.</p>

<p>"Don't believe it." The sympathetic cadence
of George Morgan's voice removed all effect of
brusqueness from his words. "No playwright was
ever normal three hours before the curtain went up
on the first night of her play in New York. Now
I'll tell you exactly how you feel."</p>

<p>"Don't," I begged. "I <i>know</i>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>"But I must!" my friend's remorseless voice went
on. "I've got to show my insight into the human
heart, as you used to say in your convent days. So
here goes. You're sinking into a bottomless pit;
you're in a blue funk; your feet are cold and your
head is hot; you're breathing with difficulty; you're
struggling with a desire to take the first train out
of town; you're wondering if you can't go to bed
and stay there. You think no one suspects these
things, for you're wearing a smile that looks as if
it had been tacked on; but it's so painful that your
father and mother keep their eyes turned away from
it. You're&mdash;"</p>

<p>"George, for Heaven's sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right; I merely wanted to show insight
and express sympathy. Having lived through four
'first nights' myself, I know what they mean. And
say, May,"&mdash;his gay voice took on a deeper note&mdash;"I
needn't tell you that Josephine and I will be going
through the whole thing with you. We've chosen
seats in the fifth row of the orchestra, instead of
taking a box, because we both expect to burst into
loud sobs of joy during your speech, and we'll feel
less exposed down on the floor. And, oh yes, wait
a minute; your god-daughter insists on kissing you
through the telephone!"</p>

<p>There was an instance's silence; then the breathless
little voice of Maria Annunciata Morgan, aged
"four 'n a half, mos' five," according to herself,
came to my ear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"'Lo, May, oh-h, May, 'lo, May," it gurgled,
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Hello, babykins," I said. "Is that a new song
you've learned that you're singing for me?"</p>

<p>"No-o-o." Maria Annunciata's tones showed her
scorn for grown-up denseness. "I was just 'ginning
my conversation," she added, with dignity.</p>

<p>I apologized.</p>

<p>"An' papa says," went on the adorable childish
treble, "'at if your play lasses till a mat'née, I&mdash;can&mdash;go&mdash;an'&mdash;see&mdash;it!"</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, so you shall, my baby," I
laughed. "And if the play lasses only a few minutes,
I'll give you a 'mat'née' all by yourself.
Where's that kiss I was to have? I need it very
much."</p>

<p>"Here 'tis. Here's fourteen an' 'leven." They
came to me over the wire in a succession of reports
like the popping of tiny corks. "An' papa says say
good-by now, so I mus'. But I love you <i>very</i> mush!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, darling. I love you very mush, too."</p>

<p>I turned from the telephone wonderfully cheered
by the little talk, but almost before I had hung up
the receiver the bell rang again.</p>

<p>"Hello, May. If you've finished that impassioned
love scene with which you have kept the wire sizzling
for the last half-hour I'd like to utter a few
calming words."</p>

<p>Bayard, a brilliantly successful playwright, was
talking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>"Feel as if you were being boiled in oil, don't
you?" was his cheery beginning. "Feel as if you
were being burned at the stake? Feel as if you were
being butchered to make a Roman holiday, and all
that kind of thing? But it's nothing to the way
you're going to feel as you drive to the theater
and as you watch the curtain go up. However,
keep a stiff upper lip. Margaret and I will be in
front, and Margaret says you can have my chest to
cry on immediately after the performance. Good
luck. Good-by."</p>

<p>Again, before I had left the room, the telephone
bell recalled me. It had been like this all day. I
had begun to believe that it would always be like
this. Life had resolved itself into a series of telephone
talks, running through a strenuous but not unpleasant
dream. Every friend I had seemed determined
to call me up and alternate rosy good wishes
with dark forebodings of disasters possible through
no fault of mine. The voice that came to me now
was that of Arthur Locke, the best actor and the
most charming gentleman on the American stage.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Miss Iverson," he said, heartily. "I
don't need to tell you all my wife and I wish for you.
But I want to give you a word of warning about the
critics. Don't let anything they do to-night disturb
you. They've all got their bag of tricks, you know,
and they go through them whether they like the
play or not. For example"&mdash;his beautiful voice took
on a delicious quality of sympathetic amusement&mdash;"Haskins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
usually drops off to sleep about the middle
of the second act. The audience is always immensely
impressed by this, and men and women exchange
glances and hushed comments over it. But it
doesn't mean anything. He wakes up again. He
slept through my entire second act last year, and
gave me an excellent notice the next morning&mdash;to
show his gratitude, I suppose. Allen usually leaves
during the middle of the third act, gathering up
his overcoat with a weary sigh and marching down
the middle aisle so that no one can miss his dramatic
exit. People are so used to it that they don't mind
it much. Northrup sits with his eyebrows up in
his pompadour, as if pained beyond expression by
the whole performance, and Elkins will take all your
best comedy with sad, sad shakes of the head. To
equalize this, however, Webster will grin over your
pathetic scenes. The best thing to do is not to look
at any of them. You know where their seats are,
don't you? Keep your eyes the other way."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said, faintly. "I think I will."</p>

<p>Beyond question Mr. Locke's intentions had been
friendly, but his words had not perceptibly soothed
my uneasy nerves. Before I walked from my study
into my living-room I stopped a moment to straighten
my shoulders and take a deep breath. My entire
family had come on from the West to attend the
first-night performance of my play in New York&mdash;my
father, my sister Grace, my brother Jack, now
a lieutenant in the army, even my delicate mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to whom journeys and excitement were not among
life's usual privileges. They were, I knew, having
tea together, and as I opened the living-room door
I found my features taking on the stiff and artificial
smile I must have unconsciously worn all day. A
saving memory of George Morgan's words came to
me in time, and I banished the smile and soberly
entered the room.</p>

<p>The members of the familiar group greeted me
characteristically. My mother, by whose chair I
stopped for an instant, smiled up at me in silence,
patting my hand. My father drew a deep, inviting
chair close to the open fire; my brother brought me
the cup of tea my sister hurriedly prepared. Each
beloved face wore a look of acute nervous strain, and
from the moment of my entrance every one talked
at once, on subjects so remote from the drama that
it seemed almost improper to introduce it by repeating
the telephone conversations I had just had.
I did so, however, and in the midst of the badinage
that followed, Stella Merrick, our "star," was announced.</p>

<p>She lived across the Square from me, and she
promptly explained as she drank her tea that she
had been "too nervous to stay at home." For her
comfort I repeated again the pregnant words of
Mr. Locke concerning the New York critics, and she
nodded in depressed confirmation. During the close
association required by our rehearsals, and our
months together "on the road," I had not analyzed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
to my satisfaction the contradictions of Miss Merrick's
temperament. She loved every line of my
play and was admirable, if not ideal, in the leading
rôle. She fiercely resented the slightest suggestion
from me, and combated almost every change I
wished to make in the text as my work revealed
itself to me more clearly during rehearsals and performances.
She seemed to have a genuine fondness
for me and a singular personal dependence. She
was uneasy if I missed a rehearsal, and had been
almost panic-stricken when once or twice during
our preliminary tour I had missed a first night in
an important city. She claimed the credit of all
merit in the play and freely passed on to me the
criticisms. The slightest suggestion made by the
"cub reporter" on any newspaper or the call-boy in
any theater seemed to have more weight with her
than any advice of mine. To-day, under the soothing
influence of tea, fire-light, and the not too stimulating
charms of family conversation, we could see
her tense nerves relax.</p>

<p>"I've been working mentally on the critics," she
confessed, as she passed her cup to Grace for the
second time. "They're the only persons I've been
afraid of here in New York. I know we'll get
our audience. We always do. And if Miss Iverson
will stand by us, and make a speech when
she's called for, we're sure to have a brilliant
night."</p>

<p>She smiled her charming smile at me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"But the New York critics are enough to appal
the strongest soul," she went on. "They're so unjust
sometimes, so merciless, so fiendishly clever in
suggesting labels that stick to one through life. Do
you remember what they said about Miss Carew&mdash;that
her play was so feminine she must have done
it with crochet needles? And they said Nazimova
looked like 'the cussed damosel,' and that Fairbanks
had the figure of Romeo and the face of the apothecary.
Those things appal me. So for the last few
days I've been working on them mentally. I believe
in mental science, you know."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment and sat stirring her tea,
a reflective haze over the brilliance of her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Some way," she resumed, "in the forty-eight
hours since I've been trying the power of mind on
them I have ceased to be afraid of the critics. I
realize now that they cannot hurt us or our work.
I know they are our friends. I have a wonderfully
kind feeling for them. Why,"&mdash;her voice took on
a seductive tenderness, her eyes dwelt on the fire
with a dreamy abstraction in their depths&mdash;"now
I almost love the damned things!" she ended, peacefully.</p>

<p>My brother Jack choked, then laughed irrepressibly.
My sister and I joined him. But my mother
was staring at Miss Merrick with startled eyes,
while Miss Merrick stared back at her with a face
full of sudden consternation.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Iverson," she gasped, "I beg your pardon!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
I didn't know what I was saying. I was&mdash;really&mdash;thinking
aloud!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later I went with her to the elevator
for a final word.</p>

<p>"I'm going straight to the theater," she told me.
"Be early, won't you? And come in to see me for
a moment just before we begin."</p>

<p>She took my hands in a grip that hurt.</p>

<p>"We're going to win," she said, as she entered the
elevator.</p>

<p>It was almost six. I had barely time to dress, to
dine comfortably, and to get to the theater before
the curtain rose. At every stage of my toilet the
inexorable telephone called me; telegrams, too, were
coming from all parts of the country. My heart
swelled. Whether I proved to be a playwright or
not, I had friends&mdash;many of them new ones, made
during the progress of this dramatic adventure.
They would not be too dearly bought, it seemed to
me then, even by failure.</p>

<p>Dinner began as a silent meal. No one cared to
talk. I recalled with a sardonic smile the invitation
of a society friend who had bought three boxes for
my first night and was giving a large dinner to precede
the play. She had expected me to grace that
function and to sit in one of her boxes; and she
would never understand, I knew, why I refused to
do so. Godfrey Morris was coming at half after
seven, with much pomp and his new limousine, to
take us to the theater. His mother and sister were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
giving a box-party, but Godfrey was to sit with us
in the body of the house. I had frankly refused to
have even him join us at dinner. Four pairs of eyes
fixed on me with loving sympathy during that repast
were, I realized, all I could endure. Even
Godfrey's understanding gaze would be the one
thing too much&mdash;because it was so understanding.</p>

<p>At the table the first few remarks of the family
dropped and lay like visible, neglected things before
us. Then Grace and Jack entered upon a discussion
which they succeeded in making animated,
and in which it was not necessary that I should take
part. It gave me an opportunity to swallow naturally,
to try to control the queer fluttering of my
heart and the sense of faintness, almost of nausea,
that threatened to overcome me. When I went to
my room to put on my evening coat I looked at myself
in the long mirror that paneled the door. To my
relief, I looked quite natural&mdash;pale, beyond question,
but I never had much color. Of the iciness and
rigidity of my hands and feet, of the panic that shook
the very soul of me, no one but myself need know.</p>

<p>I greeted Godfrey with both hands outstretched
and a real smile. I had seen him only once before
since his return three days ago from Palm Beach,
where he had gone for his convalescence after his
attack of pneumonia. He had come back for my
first night&mdash;he had made that very clear&mdash;and for
a blessed instant my panic vanished in the comfort
of his presence, of the sure grasp of his firm hands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the look in his gray eyes. In the next instant it
returned with cumulative force. I could bear failure
alone if I had to. Others, many others, had borne
it before me, and there was always the future in
which one could try again. I could bear it before
my family, for they would never believe that the
fault of failure was mine; or before the eyes of all
my friends, for the theater would be full of them.
But to bear it in the presence of Godfrey, to have
him see me fail&mdash;no, that was unthinkable. I had
reached the point where I must set my teeth, take
my nerves and my imagination in hand, and control
them as I had once controlled a team of frantic
horses plunging toward a river-bank.</p>

<p>"A good deal like being executed in the public
square, isn't it?" asked Godfrey, gently. We were
on our way up-town, and now over the whole party
a sudden silence fell. The illuminated sign of the
big Broadway theater was before us: the name of
my play and that of our "star" stared at us in letters
of fire that took strange shapes before my eyes.
My own name modestly adorned the tablet on each
side of the entrance and the bill-boards in the lobby.
The latter, when we entered it, was banked with
flowers. We were early, but the theater was filling
rapidly, and the usual throng of "first-nighters,"
equally ready for an execution or a triumph, chatted
on the sidewalk and thronged the entrance. The
house manager, his coat adorned with a white carnation,
greeted me as we passed in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>"Good luck, Miss Iverson," he said, cordially.
"Lots of telegrams here for you. Wait, I'll get
them. Here, Fred, let's have Miss Iverson's telegrams."</p>

<p>He checked the line at the box-office, thrust a
hand through the little window, and drew it out with
a thick package of the yellow envelopes. Godfrey
held out his hand.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of them, if you wish," he said, and
as I nodded he dropped them into a pocket of his
coat.</p>

<p>In silence we filed down the aisle to our seats.
The boxes were already filled; the body of the house
filled as we watched it. On every side were faces
I knew and loved&mdash;Mrs. Morris and Grace with
Colonel and Mrs. Cartwell and Mr. and Mrs. Nestor
Hurd; the Morgans, with Kittie James and Maudie
Joyce, who had come from Chicago for this big
night in my life; my friend of the rejected dinner
and her brilliantly jeweled guests; a deputation
from the <i>Searchlight</i> and my magazine offices, which,
it seemed to me, filled half the house. Mollie Merk
was there, and Billy Gibson and Mrs. Hoppen. The
occasion had the atmosphere of a reception. Every
one knew every one else; friends chatted with each
other across the aisles and visited from seat to seat.
A few came to greet me. The majority mercifully
waited, knowing I would wish them to wait. Godfrey,
sitting beside me, opened my program and found
the evening bill. As he did so I saw that his hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
shook. He followed the direction of my eyes, and his
brown cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>"I won't deny it," he whispered. "I'm as excited
as you are; probably more so."</p>

<p>Our eyes met. For a moment I almost forgot
where we were&mdash;almost, but not quite. Then Godfrey
went on.</p>

<p>"But I'm not going to tell you about that now,"
he said, quietly. "Now I'm thinking of nothing
but the play."</p>

<p>I rose hurriedly. "I'm afraid I'm not," I admitted.
"I forgot to go to Miss Merrick as I
promised."</p>

<p>He rose and went with me. From our places at
the end of the left-side aisle it was easy to slip back
of the boxes and behind the scenes. Godfrey waited
in the wings while I tapped at the door of Miss Merrick's
dressing-room and entered. The place seemed
very full. Elman, the stage director, was in the
group that surrounded the star, and Peyton, our
leading man, the latter dressed for his entrance.
Both came forward at once to shake hands. Miss
Merrick, her eyes on the mirror, following the last
touches of her make-up, smiled at me without turning.
She was pale under her rouge, and her eyes
seemed twice their usual size, but they brightened
as she saw me.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to say a word," I told her. "You
know how I feel."</p>

<p>It was clear that she hardly heard me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>"Look at all these," she said. "Everybody's
awfully kind."</p>

<p>She waved her hand, indicating the masses of
flowers around her, the litter of telegrams and notes.</p>

<p>"I'm actually frozen with fear," she went on.
"But I always am. It will pass off soon after we
begin. Am I speaking in my usual voice? It sounds
like a whisper to me."</p>

<p>I reassured her and slipped away. Elman, Peyton,
and her maid closed round her again. I heard
her describing her symptoms in detail as I closed
the door. I recognized them. They were also mine.
The theater was dark and the curtain just rising as
Godfrey and I returned to our seats. I was deeply
thankful for the gloom that enveloped me. My
mother, sitting at my right, reached out gently and
took my hand, but I was hardly conscious of the
action. For the moment there was nothing in the
world but the lighted stage on which my familiar
characters, my "dea', dea' dollies," as Maria Annunciata
called them, were going through their parts.</p>

<p>The house was very still. Every head in the great
audience was turned toward the stage, politely attentive,
willing to be interested, waiting to know
if interest was there. A moment dragged by, another
and another&mdash;the longest of my life except
the moments of the night, three months ago, when
I had awaited news from Godfrey's sick-room. And
now he was here beside me, superbly well, wholly
himself again. At the thought my heart melted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
My mind swerved for a second from the interest
on which it was focused. I turned and glanced at
him. He was leaning forward in his seat, his gray
eyes fixed unwinkingly on the stage, his face pale
under its coat of Palm Beach tan. For an instant
he did not know that I was glancing at him; then
he turned, and our eyes met in a look which taught
me that of all in the crowded house he understood
best what this hour meant to me, because it meant
as much to him. It was as if we thought with one
mind, responded with one nervous system to the
influence around us.</p>

<p>At the back of the house a little ripple began,
grew, swelled into a laugh. I drew my first deep
breath, and felt it echoed by Godfrey at my side.
Again our eyes met. His sparkled in the dimness.
Another laugh rippled around us, swelled, reached
the balconies, and rolled down from there. I heard
the whisper of silk and the creak of seats as the members
of my family at last settled comfortably into
their seats.</p>

<p>"By Jove," whispered Godfrey, "you've got them!
They're with you!"</p>

<p>For the time at least we had them. The big,
kindly-disposed audience, anxious to be pleased, met
every comedy line with a quick response which grew
more generous as the moments passed. The entrance
of the star brought an ovation which temporarily
checked the progress of the play. Under
it Miss Merrick's brilliant eyes lost their look of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
strain. She touched her highest moments in the
pathos of her entrance scene. The audience was
again very quiet. Around us handkerchiefs rustled;
Godfrey's eyes, meeting mine, were wet, and my
heart turned to water as I looked at them. That
he should be moved like that by my play&mdash;no, by
<i>our</i> play. Everything, I knew, was <i>ours</i> henceforth.</p>

<p>The curtain went down and the lights flared up.
The audience had been amused, interested, touched.
It called out the players and called them out again,
while the curtain rose and fell, rose and fell, and
the members of the company, smiling now and
with all their panic gone, came before the footlights
singly and in groups. So far all was well. Whatever
happened later, we had had a triumphant first
act. Already the play was a third over. I had no
fears now as to the success of the second act. It was
almost wholly comedy, and the comedy had "got
over" with a rush. But the third act&mdash;I was by
no means sure of the third act, where our manager's
scene of hysteria, the fatal scene he had introduced
during the dress rehearsal, still claimed its deadly
moments.</p>

<p>My friends were coming up to greet me&mdash;George
Morgan, Bayard, a dozen of them, congratulatory,
jubilant.</p>

<p>"Josephine can't cross the house yet to speak to
you herself," explained George, airily, "because her
nose isn't fit to be seen. She's crying for joy over
there. She'll get around after the next act."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"You've got 'em," said Bayard, heartily. "They're
<i>eating</i> your comedy and spoiling their complexions
over your pathos. What more do you want? Shall
I call for the author now, or wait till the end of the
second act?"</p>

<p>My mother's gentle voice was in my ear.</p>

<p>"I'm so very happy, dear," she said, quietly.</p>

<p>I looked at my father. The nod he gave me, the
expression in his eyes, were the most beautiful
things I had ever seen, except the tears in Godfrey's
eyes. Except&mdash;was it possible that at last I was
putting some one else before my father? It was
possible. It was more than possible; it was certain.
For Godfrey himself was speaking now,
and nothing else had given me the thrill that
came at the sound of the quiet voice so close to
my ear.</p>

<p>"May," he whispered. "Dear May, I'm so glad!"</p>

<p>That was all, but it was gloriously complete. And
now the second act was on, with the rollicking
comedy of which I felt so sure. Around us the audience
rocked and laughed, breaking out frequently
into little whirlwinds of applause. The strain of
rehearsals had had its effect on my feeling for various
members of the company, but to-night as I
watched them it seemed to me that I loved them
all, for beyond doubt each was giving all that was
in him toward the winning of the success that now
seemed assured.</p>

<p>"Your hand is cold even through your glove,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
whispered Godfrey. "That's the only sign you
show of nervousness."</p>

<p>In the darkness he was holding it close.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful to be going through this with
you," he whispered.</p>

<p>"It was wonderful of you to come back for it,"
I said.</p>

<p>He laughed, a little laugh of warm content.</p>

<p>"Do you think I could have kept away?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I could not answer. The night was giving me too
much. The curtain was coming down, only to rise
again and again and again as the house let itself
loose in the joyful tumult of friendly hearts that
can at last let friendly impulse have its way. Again
and again the golden head of Stella Merrick bent
before the storm of applause that greeted her repeated
appearance. Again and again the members
of the company responded, singly and together.
Again and again the light flashed up, only to be
lowered as the uproar continued.</p>

<p>And now they were calling for the author in an
insistent, steady call, from gallery, balcony, and orchestra&mdash;a
call that tolerated no failure to respond.
My knees shook under me as I rose. To walk the
length of the house and out on that empty, waiting
stage seemed impossible, but perhaps I could say
something here, standing in my place. For a second
I stood undiscovered; then, as if on a concerted
signal, every head in the house turned toward me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
There was a whirl of greeting, of applause, which
my loyal friends led and prolonged.</p>

<p>"Speech! Speech! Speech!" The word came
at me from every corner of the theater. My knees
steadied. My voice, as I began, sounded natural,
even casual. It seemed all at once the simplest
matter in the world to say a few words to this wonderful
audience, so receptive, so enthusiastic, so
friendly.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," I began. "I shall not
try to make a speech. No author should attempt
that on a first night. Many are called, and some
get up, but very few get over."</p>

<p>I had to stop. These charming people thought
that remark was amusing, too, and joyfully applauded
it.</p>

<p>"But I am glad of this opportunity," I continued,
"to express my deep obligation to our manager,
to Miss Merrick, and to the members of the company
for all they have done for my play. And in their
behalf first, and then in my own, I thank you for
the wonderful reception you have given us."</p>

<p>That was all. There was more applause. The
lights flashed up, and from every part of the theater
the men and women I knew came to me for a few
friendly words. The reception took in my little
family party and Mr. Morris, whose presence among
us seemed to interest but not to surprise the big
delegation from the <i>Searchlight</i>.</p>

<p>"Now," I whispered to him, as the curtain rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
on the third act, "if only everything goes well for
half an hour more! But the least little thing can
wreck an act. If some one sneezes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If any one sneezes during this act," whispered
Godfrey, firmly, "he'll never sneeze again."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a cat will run across the stage," I whispered,
"or some one in the audience will see a mouse."</p>

<p>Godfrey shook his head.</p>

<p>"This isn't that kind of an evening," he declared.
"The gods are giving their personal attention to it."</p>

<p>It seemed, indeed, that they were. The act went
on as smoothly as silk thread running through a
shuttle. We had a few additional moments of celebration
at the end of it, when the curtain fell on an
audience that wiped its eyes over the penultimate
line even while it laughed over the last line. I went
"behind" for a word of appreciation to Miss Merrick
and the company before I left the theater. The
great bulk of "T. B.," our manager, loomed huge
in the star's dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Hello, Miss Iverson!" was his jocund greeting.
"You can't always go by the enthusiasm of a first-night
audience, but I guess we've got a play here
that will run a year or two."</p>

<p>He shook hands, said something to Miss Merrick
about photographs in the morning, and swung away.
Miss Merrick, emotional, almost hysterical, fell upon
my neck and kissed me with lips that left round red
spots on my cheeks. Every one was happy. At
the front entrance some of my friends were waiting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
There was still one thing I wanted, had to have, indeed,
and I got it after I had torn open half a dozen
of my telegrams.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Our love, dear May, and our prayers for your success.</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Sister Irmingarde.</span></p>

<p>I handed the message to Maudie and Kittie, who
were with me. They had both been crying; their
eyes moistened again.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought all this could happen,
when we were school-girls at St. Catharine's!" whispered
Maudie. "Do you remember your first play,
May&mdash;the one we girls put on?" I remembered.
I could laugh at that tragedy now.</p>

<p>I heard Godfrey's voice speaking with a sudden
masterfulness.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," he was saying to my father,
"I'll send you home in my car and take May for a
little spin in the Park in a taxi-cab. I think she
needs half an hour of quiet and fresh air."</p>

<p>My father smiled at him.</p>

<p>"I think she does," he agreed.</p>

<p>There were more congratulations, more hand-shaking,
before I could get away. Then I found
myself with Godfrey in a taxi-cab which was making
its purring way up Fifth Avenue. It was strangely
restful to be alone with him after the strain and excitement
of the past three hours. I closed my eyes
and leaned back against the cushions, my mind at
first a whirling kaleidoscope in which the scenes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
the evening repeated themselves over and over.
Then, in the darkness and the silence, they began
to disappear. Suddenly there seemed nothing in
the world but Godfrey and me. He had leaned forward
and taken my hand. We had entered the Park
and were slipping along an avenue of awake and
watchful trees.</p>

<p>"Well, May," he said, gently.</p>

<p>My heart slipped a beat. There was a new quality
in the voice which throbbed and shook a little.
"I've waited almost five years," he went on. "Isn't
that long enough? Won't you come to me now?"</p>

<p>He held out his arms in the dark cab, and I entered
them. From their wonderful shelter I heard
his next words.</p>

<p>"Marrying me," he said, "won't mean that
you're giving up anything you have. You are only
adding me to it. I shall be as much interested in
your books and your plays as you are yourself.
You know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>But I interrupted him. In that moment books
and plays seemed like the snows of yesteryear.</p>

<p>"Godfrey," I said, "do you imagine that I'm
thinking of books and plays now? Let's talk about
the real things."</p>

<p>The taxi-cab sang on its way. The trees that
lined the broad drive of the Park raced beside us,
keeping us company. Far above them a tiny new
moon smiled down. My professional life, like the
lights of the Avenue, lay behind me. Little in it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
seemed to count in the new world I was entering.
Until to-night I had been merely a player waiting
in the wings. Now, out in front, I heard the orchestra
playing. The curtain of life was going up, and
I had my cue in Godfrey's voice.</p>
